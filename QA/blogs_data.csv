How can MSMEs make their manufacturing processes more efficient to save time and money?
Key Highlights
• Go through your workflows and production data to find potential causes of bottlenecks
• RFID and advanced analytics are just two technologies playing a key part in the evolution of the steel industry
• Machinery and technology may be important but an efficient workforce creates winning solutions
• Businesses that master demand forecasting can control their destiny
Efficiently managed factories are more productive, profitable, and have happier employees. Not surprisingly, manufacturers are constantly looking for ways to improve efficiency across their production processes.
Here are a few strategies that can go a long way towards making your manufacturing plant more efficient.
Streamline your workflow
A manufacturing plant needs to function like clockwork. Multiple processes and production lines must work in harmony, with one process taking off when another one ends. Bottlenecks in any part of the manufacturing unit can have a cascading impact. For example, a delay in the supply of raw material can throw the entire production cycle out of gear, and lead to losses.
One of the ways to improve efficiency is to closely track and review your workflows. Analyse your production data to pinpoint areas of concern or flag potential bottlenecks. Look at different aspects of your workflow, including human resources, machinery, technology, and processes. Is one shift more efficient than the other? What makes it so? Is one line more productive than another? Is there a lot of downtime on a particular piece of machinery?
Systems such as MES (Manufacturing Execution System) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) are designed to help managers and decision-makers optimise workflows on the shop floor and improve production. Research needs to be conducted to find the right tool for your organisation, as each tool has its advantages and disadvantages.
Invest in technology
Technology is a powerful enabler of efficiency. If you are looking at growth and scale, you must invest in upgrading your equipment and plants. The steel industry globally is increasingly investing in automation. Manufacturers are using sensors, information technology, industrial robots, and AI to significantly improve productivity and quality and reduce costs and time.
Technologies such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) are helping manufacturers maintain optimal inventory levels and reduce costs of inventory management. They leverage digital data stored in RFID tags and codes to identify individual items. By scanning RFID, organisations can keep track of inventory levels, sales, inventory gaps, and sale patterns.
Quality employee training
Investments in technology without corresponding investments in training your employees and upgrading their skills could be counterproductive. While it is important to train employees on operating specific pieces of equipment, do not ignore coaching the workforce on broader concepts such as workflow management, information technology, and time management.
It is equally important to train employees in quality improvement and safety measures. A single quality or safety incident can hurt the reputation of a company. Organisations can invest in seminars and training sessions from experts in various disciplines to up-skill the workforce and ensure that the same language and ethos permeates throughout the organisation at various levels.
Manage your inventory
Maintaining optimal inventory levels is a fine art – it requires a deep understanding of not only your own production processes but also an insight into the supply chain dynamics and customer demand. The task is challenging, as managers must hold enough inventory to ensure smooth production while minimizing the risks and costs of stocking too much. Techniques such as just-in-time inventory management, and minimum order quantity must be studied and assessed by individual benefits to identify the right fit for an organisation. Many steel units use predictive analytics and supply chain software to streamline their inventory control processes. These systems automatically alert managers of expected supply chain bottlenecks and delays. Demand forecasting, based on historical data, can also help steel units optimise inventory. Forecasting can tell you, for example, how many units of your product customers are likely to buy in the next three months. Based on this data, you can plan your inventory and production cycles.
Mastering demand forecasting and regulated inventory management is the path to optimising your plant’s productivity. The best way to do this is by staying is by upgrading and updating your systems on a regular basis.

Slabs, beams, columns, and footings ensure the structural integrity of buildings. In this blog, we will delve into the specifics of each element and the materials commonly used, focusing on mild steel (MS) and its properties.
Slab construction
What is a slab?
A slab is a flat, horizontal structural element that creates building floors and ceilings. It provides a solid surface and distributes loads to the underlying beams and columns. Slabs are typically made from reinforced concrete, which offers excellent compressive strength.
Types of slabs

• One-way slab: supported by beams on two opposite sides, where loads are transferred in one direction.
• Two-way slab: supported by beams on all four sides, distributing loads in two directions.
• Flat slab: directly supported by columns without beams, ideal for commercial buildings.
• Hollow core slab: precast slabs with hollow sections to reduce weight and improve efficiency.
Materials used
Steel reinforcement is critical in slab construction. Mild steel (MS), known for its ductility and strength, is often used as reinforcing bars (rebars). The price of mild steel per kg can vary based on market conditions but is a significant factor in the overall construction cost.
Beam construction 

What is a beam?
A beam is a horizontal structural element that supports loads from the slab and transfers them to columns and footings. By resisting bending forces, beams are essential for maintaining a building's structural integrity. 



Beams are often made from steel due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. Mild steel is commonly used, offering a balance of strength, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. The mild steel price per kg is a crucial consideration in budgeting for beam construction.
Column construction

What is a column?
A column is a vertical structural element that transfers loads from the beams and slabs to the footings. Columns are essential for supporting a building's weight and maintaining its stability.
Types of columns

• Rectangular or square columns: common in residential buildings for their simplicity and ease of construction.
• Circular columns: often used in high-rise buildings and bridges due to their aesthetic appeal and uniform load distribution.
• L- and t- shaped columns: used in corner and T-junctions of structures to support adjacent walls and beams.
• 
Materials used
Steel columns provide significant advantages due to their strength and ability to withstand compressive loads. Mild steel, known for its excellent properties, is a preferred choice in column construction.
Footing construction
What is a footing?
Footings are the foundational elements that distribute the structure's load to the soil. They are critical in preventing excessive settlement and ensuring the building's stability.
Types of footings

• Strip footing: continuous strip of concrete supporting load-bearing walls.
• Isolated footing: supports individual columns, typically used in residential buildings.
• Raft footing: large continuous slab supporting multiple columns and walls, ideal for poor soil conditions.
• Pile footing is used when the soil is weak. It involves long columns (piles) driven deep into the ground.

Types of beams
Materials used

Materials used

Footings are usually made from reinforced concrete, incorporating steel reinforcement to enhance tensile strength, ductility  and durability. Due to their favourable properties, mild steel rebars are commonly used in footing construction.
Steel in construction
Steel is a fundamental material in modern construction, known for its versatility and strength. Steel beams, such as ISMB, NPB, WPB, and UB, are used based on specific structural requirements. Mild steel is widely used due to its balance of strength, ductility, and affordability. The properties of mild steel, including its tensile strength and resistance to corrosion, make it an ideal choice for reinforcing concrete elements.
Mild steel properties

• Ductility: allows for significant deformation before failure, providing warning signs of structural issues.
• Strength: offers high tensile strength, used in reinforcing concrete structures.
• Cost-effectiveness: relatively low cost per kg compared to other materials, making it a popular choice in construction.
A stable building structure relies on slabs, beams, columns, and footings working together to support loads and ensure stability. Slabs make up the floors and ceilings, distributing loads to the beams. The beams then transfer these loads to the vertical columns, which carry the forces down to the footings. Footings spread these loads over a larger area to prevent excessive settlement and ensure the structure remains stable. This hierarchical load transfer—from slabs to beams to columns to footings—ensures effective and safe distribution of loads to the ground, maintaining the building's integrity."

To have an in-depth understanding of these metals and their usage, it is important to first understand what these teams mean, what makes these two types of steel different from each other and how to choose the right material. Here’s a detailed explanation for the same.
Both these metals are not all that different from each other by definition. That said, the advantages and drawbacks of galvalume and galvanized steel differ significantly, including their longevity, durability, and performance.
Galvanized Steel
This type of steel consists of a piece of steel that is cleaned and dipped into molten zinc. Following this, the zinc hardens onto the steel, thus creating a coating of extra protection. This enables the steel to combat dents, nicks, corrosion and rust.
Galvanized steel is the go-to option when it comes to construction, fabrication and manufacturing because of its durability and high resistance to corrosion. Galvanization can be found on a majority of steel structures. In general, galvanized steel will last nearly 15-20 years, requiring minimal maintenance.
One of the significant drawbacks of galvanized steel is that if the coating of zinc is scratched off the surface, the steel is left totally unprotected and subject to failure.
Galvalume
First, a tad bit of background. Galvalume was successfully invented in 1972 by Bethlehem Steel. It is basically a trademarked name, but many individuals use the term generically to describe a product of metal roofing that consists of a steel coil coated with an alloy of metal.
Galvalume consists of a sheet of steel that is dipped in a coating of aluminium (55%), zinc (43.4%), and silicon (1.6%). This unique coating imparts a greater protection to steel from the elements, which gives it the ability to outlast and outperform traditional galvanized steel.
Overall, galvalume is ideal as a roof, trim, wall, accent and much more in a majority of building applications. Moreover, it has proven its calibre in the most extreme and harsh environments, including high-temperature areas, hurricane zones, and regions that receive heavy rainfall or snowfall.
Galvanized vs Galvalume
As can be seen, the primary difference between galvanized and galvalume

is the type of protective coating around each sheet of steel. Galvanized steel has a coating of zinc, whereas galvalume’s coating is a combination of zinc, aluminium and silicon.
Both metal types are ideal for roofing, and each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Galvalume is much more durable and has a greater longevity, with a lifespan that is twice that of galvanized steel. Galvanized steel, on the other hand, is more cost-effective, while still offering great performance. This makes it an ideal choice for those on a stringent budget.

This included two wheelers, three wheelers, quadricycles, passenger vehicles, and commercial vehicles. In 2019, multiple issues caused India’s auto economy to contract. Key among these were regulatory, rising input costs, semiconductor shortages, taxation, insufficient credit, and reduced spend on non-essentials. Even as the industry scrambled to offset this slowdown, the Covid-19 pandemic struck unexpectedly in two back-to-back waves.
India’s auto sector - gaining momentum
By August 2021, improved vaccination rates and preventive measures paid off and the devastating coronavirus is in a recession. As the rest of the Indian economy opened up progressively and the supply chain crisis in the auto sector eased up a bit, car sales also began emerging out of the slump.
Between September and October 2021, car makers posted a 40.1 percent growth in sales. The country’s passenger vehicle (cars, utility vehicles, vans) market is poised to hit 5 million-plus units by the end of 2024. Cars represent a major chunk of the passenger market.
Global automakers increasingly see India as a promising destination for automotive engineering design services (AEDS), especially for compact cars. This segment is expected to grow further on the back of growing acceptance of Indian engineering skills and government incentives. Battery electric and hydrogen fuel vehicles, as well as other advanced mobility options are also on the government’s agenda.

New incentives for auto industry
The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for automotive and auto components, announced this September is expected to increase India's share of the global automotive pie, apart from adding more jobs, in the next five years. The initiative incentivizes auto OEMs and component manufacturers working on advanced technology products and aims to attract fresh investments to these sectors over the next five years. Overall, these PLI incentives are expected to boost the production and export of advanced vehicles. New vehicle sales will also experience potential tailwinds from the vehicle scrappage policy announced by the government. As per the new policy, old, faulty and polluting commercial and passenger vehicles will be marked for deregistration. Besides, under the Automotive Mission Plan, both the government and auto industry envision a three-fold rise in the industry’s revenue in the next five years.
Currently the auto sector contributes 7.1 percent of India’s GDP; the plan will increase this contribution to 12 percent as well as add millions of jobs in the sector. India aspires to be a $5 trillion economy by 2025, and the automotive sector is key to this growth.
Demand for high-strength auto steel
While alternatives materials (plastic, aluminum, composites) have been suggested from time to time for use in car manufacture,
automotive steel
remains the most preferred raw material across the world. And this has been the case for almost a century now. The reasons being its high-strength, durability, and reliability.
At a per-unit-level, nearly 840kg of steel goes into each compact car. On average, this alloy accounts for 60% of a vehicle’s weight. Most of this steel is used in the body, closures, and
vehicle frame
, including powertrain, engine, tires, and suspension system components. Not surprisingly, the automotive industry contributes about 10-12% of the overall steel demand in India. The majority of new vehicles use
advanced high strength steels
.
Need for steel industry to scale production
A thriving industry like the automotive sector needs a steady and timely supply of high-quality
automotive steel
. The country's steel production capacity stands at 143.91 million tons; the private sector accounts for more than four-fifths of this output. The top steel producers, including private and public sector players, have significant throughputs, with respect to automotive steel

of every variety – light, mid, and high-strength. It’s certainly one of those win-win scenarios.
In order to make the best use of this favorable circumstance in the
steel marketplace
, India’s steel manufacturers would need to ramp up production by a factor of 2 or even 3 in order to keep pace with the auto sector that is gunning for growth. Apart from streamlining production, it’s important that steel industry participants offer comprehensive solutions that address all of their clients’ steel requirements. After all, one size doesn’t fit all.  For instance, MSMEs have
high quality, cost and delivery expectations
. They like to work with steel solution providers who can also provide after-sales insights and inputs.  So, the industry definitely needs to do a lot more in order to exceed the demands of various clients, especially micro, small and medium businesses.

• Strong customer understanding is key for business growth online
• From effective digital marketing to establishing partnerships, there are several ways to widen your customer base.
• Every method of online growth may not be applicable for your business. Choose wisely.
Businesses whether big or small, aim to grow and expand their reach. One of the ways in which many businesses, particularly MSMEs, can look to drive growth is through digital marketing. Whether your business is B2B (business conducted between one business and another, such as a wholesaler and retailer) or B2C (a direct-to-retail or customer facing business, such as a storefront), you can use digital to build your brand, reach new customers and generate more business. Here is a roadmap to getting your business to grow and generate leads via digital:
Is your customer online?
It might seem fairly obvious. However, there is a strong reason why you should think long and hard about the answer. The number of active internet users in 2020 was about 300 million plus. That means a large population isn’t active on the internet. If your potential customer is not among the 300 million active internet users, you may want to consider more traditional approaches. You must understand who your customer is, what she does online and what her interests are before formulating your digital strategy.
Push versus pull
If your customer is active online, there are two ways you can reach them: pushing your content to them (targeted advertising) or pulling them to your content (content and search marketing). Platforms such as Google and Facebook allow you to target specific sets of audiences and pull them to your content, website or online store. You can target audiences by interest, location, keywords and many other factors. A more organic way of reaching potential customers is through creating content that people can find search engines. Search engines like Google drive anywhere between 60-90% of a website’s traffic. Search engine optimization is the art and science of creating content that ranks on sites like Google. For example, if you are a manufacturer of surgical instruments, you would want to rank among the top three results when users search for surgical instrument manufacturers on Google.
Targeting the elusive one
If your customer does not use the internet heavily or if their interests are not known, then previously collected customer data can be used to reach them. Social media platforms allow you to leverage existing customer databases. Phone numbers, names, email addresses and other data can help you directly target your customers. Some online advertising platforms such as Facebook and Google even allow for ‘lookalike audiences’ where potential new customers with similar profiles to those of your existing customers can be targeted.
CRM to the rescue
Customer databases can also be leveraged to reach out to customers directly. Since you have a means to reach out to them - email addresses, phone numbers etc., can all be fed into CRM (customer relationship management) tools that are available via the internet. These tools allow you to send marketing content directly to your customers. Powerful analytics and reports help you understand what appeals to them, and what does not, helping you hone your marketing strategy. You could always reach out to them directly via email or messages, however the chances of success would most definitely be much lower. Too many messages and emails may lead to frustrated customers; irrelevant content on the other hand may confuse them about your intentions.
Rewarding loyalty and digital referrals
Do you have repeat customers who prefer doing business with you? You can grow your database (and potential leads) by incentivising these existing customers to share information about their network via referrals. From discounts on purchases, to rewards such as bonuses, vacations, and cashbacks etc., there are many new and innovative ways to reach potential new customers. The best part? Quality leads are often easily sourced, and sometimes at fractional costs versus just running ads on the internet.
Final note:
The key to unlocking strong digital outcomes for your business is understanding your customers and their behaviour on the internet. If you know what they do, where they go, and what kind of content they consume, you can easily find ways to reach them. The final step relies on your ability to persuade them, and make the sale."

Key highlights:
• Ranking on page 1 of Google search is the key to getting traffic to your website
• Great content has the potential to rank higher on Google
• Take advantage of the My Business Account feature to be visible to nearby customers

If you are thinking of expanding your steel business and want to acquire new customers digitally, a website is the first place to start. But how do you get prospective customers to discover your website and visit it? The answer is simple: optimise Google search.
Billions of people use Google every day to research a variety of products and services. For example, if you manufacture steel bearings, you would want to be visible to customers searching for ‘steel bearing manufacturers’ on Google search, wouldn’t you? Here’s how you can make that happen.
How Google search works: 101
Google innumerable documents in its search index. When a user searches for ‘steel bearing manufacturers’, it retrieves relevant content (websites, web pages, videos, ads, businesses etc) and shows it to you as search results. The search results are ranked in order of relevance, automated by a complex algorithm.
Most users don’t look beyond the first page of results, which is a listing of the 10 most relevant web pages matching a query. Now, if you don’t rank among these 10 results, the likelihood of you getting a lot of traffic from the search term ‘steel bearing manufacturers’ is minuscule.
So, the objective is always to try and rank in the top 10 results of Google search for queries that are relevant to you.
How to improve your ranking on Google search?
How does Google rank a website or a web page in relation to a user query? One of the most important factors (but not the only one, mind you) is the content of your website. This could be in the form of blogs, articles, videos, etc...
Do you have content that is relevant to the query ‘steel bearing manufacturers’ or any other, applicable key terms? Is that content unique? Is it better in quality than other websites that already rank in the top 10? Is the content updated regularly? These are a few points to keep in mind when improving your search-ability.
While there are many steps that you can take to improve your ranking, building great content should be the first.
Starting your content journey
Where should you start your content journey? While there are several good third-party tools, we would recommend that you start with the
Google Keyword Planner
. You can access this by creating a free Google Adwords account with any Gmail ID. The planner will help you narrow down on the kind of terms that users type into Google. For example, ‘steel bearing manufacturer’ has lower than 10 global searches a month, while ‘steel bearings’ and ‘steel ball bearings’ have anywhere between 100 and 1000 searches per month. The planner also gives you other keyword suggestions related to your business: ‘stainless steel bearings’, ‘metal ball bearings’ etc.
Once you have a list of keywords, type them into Google and look at the sites or pages that rank for those search terms. You can take cues from those sites and create better or more valuable content than them. Intelligently written and regularly updated content will translate into more traffic and, eventually, more customers.
More ways to grow with Google
Beyond Google Search, there are many other aspects that customers may consider before making a decision to reach out. Therefore it is necessary to cover all your bases, so that customers believe in the legitimacy of your business. The first step is to list your business on Google.

How will the recent production-linked incentive scheme for specialty steel impact the industry
Key Takeaways:
• In July 2021, the Indian government announced production-linked incentives for the specialty steel industry
• The scheme provides financial incentives to promote manufacture of specialty steel in the country
• The government has planned an outlay of Rs 6322 crore towards this scheme
Introduction to PLI
In the 2021-22 budget in February this year, the finance minister announced an outlay of 1.9 lakh crore for production-linked incentive schemes across 13 sectors. Of these, PLI schemes for three sectors had been approved in March 2020 and 10 sectors in November 2020.
In July 2021, the cabinet gave its nod for PLIs in specialty steel. Many industry insiders believe this could be a game-changer for the industry.
So, what exactly is a production-linked incentive and why is the government offering them?
The fundamental idea behind the incentive scheme is to boost domestic production by offering financial incentives to manufacturers. The incentive is offered as a percentage of incremental sales and varies from sector to sector – ranging from 4-15%.
PLIs are aimed at achieving many objectives:
• Increase domestic production
• Reduce imports
• Make Indian products more competitive both domestically and internationally
• Attract investments, both domestic and international
• Create a greater number of jobs
PLI and the steel sector
The PLI scheme for specialty steel, announced in July 2021, has been whole-heartedly welcomed by the steel industry.
Though India is the second largest producer of steel in the world, specialty or value-added steel accounts for only 18% of the total. In 2020-21, specialty steel accounted for 18mt of the 102mt steel produced in the country. India was a net importer of value-added steel (4mt), resulting in a forex outgo of Rs 30,000 crore.
The incentive scheme aims to boost the manufacture of higher grades of steel in the country and reduce our dependence on imports and reduce input cost for downstream MSME manufacturers.
What are the incentives and for whom?
The specialty steel PLI scheme offers three slabs of incentives with the lowest being 4 per cent and the highest being 12 per cent. These incentives are offered on incremental sales across five categories of specialty steel over the next five years. The first incentive will be payable in FY23-24 based on incremental sales achieved in 2022-23.
The incentive pay out is calculated according to the following formula:
A: Incremental sales in current year over previous year (or base year)
B: Weighted average sale price (exclusive of tax) in the current year
C: Weighted average sale price (exclusive of tax) in the base year
Incentive = (A/B) x (lower of B or C) x (PLI rate as applicable / 100)
What categories of specialty steel are eligible?
Five categories of specialty steel are covered:
• High strength/ wear resistant steel
• Coated/ plated steel products
• Alloy steel products and steel wires
• Specialty rails
• Electrical steel
The incentives are based on the category of steel being manufactured. For example, electrical steel or cold rolled grain-oriented steel gets the maximum incentive of 12%.
Who is eligible to apply for the incentives?
There are no special eligibility criteria. Any company manufacturing specialty grades of steel can apply for the scheme. The only condition is that the input material should have been melted or poured in India to ensure that the products are manufactured end-to-end in India.
The potential impact of the PLI
• Total incentives: Rs 6322 crore
• Additional investments expected: Rs 40,000 crore
• Employment: 525,000 jobs including 60k direct jobs
• Capacity addition: 25mt
Besides these benefits, the PLI scheme for specialty steel is expected to achieve three key outcomes: 1) reduce our dependence on imports for value-added steel, 2) reduce supply chain issues for local manufacturers as more specialty steel will be manufactured end-to-end in India and 3) increase investments in technology in the sector and, ultimately, enable the domestic industry to produce higher and higher grades of steel."

MSMEs create a vast number of job opportunities, drive innovation, and function as an incubator for future multinational corporations.
MSMEs, which contribute to nearly 45% of India’s GDP (gross domestic product), are suffering primarily due to supply and demand issues. Moreover, they are rapidly losing their small reserves and may not be able to survive the crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic, unless they are provided substantive support immediately.
Challenges faced by MSMEs in the last few years
MSMEs, which are the backbone of the country’s economy and an employment provider to more than 114 million Indians, have gone through extremely challenging times during the past 3-5 years.
The fact remains that they have had to face one setback after another, such as those mentioned below:
• Demonetisation
• Flawed implementation of GST
• Economic slowdown in the real estate and auto sector
• Financial and banking crisis
• COVID-19
Signs of an impending decline are already visible. The sector has already begun to face a huge financial burden of unpaid salaries (which will ultimately result in loss of jobs), unpaid EMIs (which will severely affect the balance sheets of financial institutions), and eventual closure of such operations. Balance sheets that are loss-making do not allow MSMEs to obtain finance from banks or NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) as per norms by the RBI, thus resulting in an increased pileup of unsold inventory, entry into the arena of dead investments, and massive losses.
What is the future of MSMEs in India?
• Collateral-free automatic loans will provide small businesses with an opportunity to bounce back from the impact of the pandemic.
• The economic stimulus will help various MSMEs in resuming operations by offering access to credit to help in overcoming near term loss of income. This will further enable MSMEs to grow as well as maintain the continuity of business. The long-term focus on enabling MSMEs with state-of-the-art technology also offers a fantastic opportunity for businesses to thrive.
• Most logistics depend on the manufacturing sector. These options announced by the Government of India will enable them to resume business operations, thus also resuming the movement of goods, which, in turn, will benefit the logistics industry, as well.
• The MSME sector has faced a lingering problem in the form of delayed payment. To overcome this, the government announced that the Centre and the Central Public Sector Enterprises would honour every MSME receivable.
• Moreover, E-market linkage will also be provided to all MSMEs as a replacement to exhibitions and trade fairs. This economic stimulus will surely prove to be quite a game-changer for Indian businesses.
• The economic stimulus package is primarily focused on local shops, which are responsible for the generation of 40% of employment opportunities and the driver for more than 90% of retail commerce. This will ensure that the economy is restarted from its very foundations. Moreover, it will help in building a highly locally-driven shockproof system for the future, thus fulfilling the mission of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” or “Self-reliant India.”
• The government’s decision of barring global tenders from successfully procuring up to Rs 200 crores will eventually increase MSME registrations on several e-procurement sites. The Indian government’s e-procurement sites have largely been flooded by large, foreign players who bring an unfair advantage when it comes to pricing and size. MSMEs functioning as ancillary units (such as autos and infrastructure) lose the bids on smaller deals. This move should enhance the competitiveness of Indian MSMEs when it comes to government contracts. It must also see a significant increase in registrations by MSMEs and mid-market businesses on these platforms.
On a Final Note:
While the role played by MSMEs is frequently highlighted in the context of the generation of employment and contribution to economic growth as well as balanced regional development, it is crucial that these enterprises are highly sustainable and have the ability to deliver scale. Though contributing phenomenally to exports, MSMEs of India are still not regarded as formidable forces in international markets. When it comes to the future, the primary challenges lie in building the next generation of MSMEs that can successfully function as a powerhouse of the Indian economy. With fierce competition at the global level and the subsequent demands that have arisen due to globalisation, it is presently imperative for Indian MSMEs to demonstrate prominent levels of competitiveness, successfully position themselves strategically, and eventually leverage their engagement in global value chains or GVCs."

Of course, the quality, cost, and delivery expectations are quite high in this sector. So, a mutually beneficial relationship exists between logistics players and automobile producers on one hand and
steel metal suppliers
and
steel products
on the other.


Market participants in logistics
Market participants in the country’s logistics sector demonstrate a varying breadth of capabilities such as full/part truckload providers (e.g., VRL) and express parcel transporters (e.g., GATI). The logistics landscape also includes shippers of cross-border air and sea freight (like Gateway Distriparks) as well as supply chain service providers (like DHL). Then there are businesses like the Container Corporation that focus on rail freight.
What is holding back the sector?
The logistics sector in India is highly fragmented. Most drivers own single trucks; 85% of truck operators own less than 20 trucks. The vast majority of trucks in India
are either 2-axle or 3-axle carriers with a load-carrying capacity of 28 tons at the most.  Organised logistics providers account for less than 4% of the market and their services hardly ever extend beyond the top cities and special economic zones. Some of India’s e-commerce majors boast sprawling and tech-savvy warehouses, located on large parcels of land outside big cities. That said, 9 out of 10 warehouses in India are smaller than 10,000 sq ft.
India’s logistics spend is reckoned to be around 13% of the GDP (nearly $400 billion), a major drag on the economy. The country’s logistics costs compare rather unfavourably with the global average of nearly 8%. Transport expenses are significantly lower in the US and Europe because of supply chain efficiencies achieved by embracing smart techniques and a well-integrated technology infrastructure. By contrast, a large number of logistics operators in India make do with siloed systems that do not communicate so well with each other.
New holistic approach to logistics
The holistic national logistics policy (NLP) announced by the Indian government in December 2019, aims to overcome challenges bedevilling smooth cargo movement in the country. Among other things, NLP is expected to create the right environment that will help providers reduce their logistics costs by up to 8% of the GDP in five years’. The much-awaited policy puts emphasis on redesigning logistics processes and converting information held in analog format to digital. This will ensure more openness in terms of operations, enable continuous tracking of logistics metrics, and improve knowledge sharing across the sector.
Smart technologies at work
The “holistic logistics ecosystem” envisioned by the government and industry is going to be powered by a host of smart techniques. For instance, the geotagging feature can be applied to warehouses, cold storage facilities, refrigerated trucks/vans, and delivery persons. This generates streams of data, which, in turn, will help in easily tracking the movement of goods, location of warehouses, and availability of storage space on a map.
All this data is fed into a centralised database and anyone can access the same through an app on a need basis. Besides, using advanced camera systems to automatically capture and process goods-related data at warehouses and logistics companies will certainly drive employee efficiency and ensure cost savings. Furthermore, statistical algorithms can be run on past data as well as data continuously generated by different sources in the logistics ecosystem to predict future trends and streamline operations.
Multimodal logistics parks
The government plans to develop multi-modal logistics parks in 15 locations across the country for seamless cargo movement involving different modes of transport. Such parks will comprise container freight stations for sea cargo, inland container depots linked by rail to nearby gateway ports, and freight terminals at ports for processing shipments. This arrangement will decongest ports, eliminate chokepoints, and improve overall connectivity while lowering freight costs.
The NLP hopes to improve trade competitiveness, create more jobs, and help the country emerge as a major logistics hub. However, a lot depends on how soon the sector can be digital-ready. Tapping private investment and initiative to develop contemporary warehouses, freight terminals, and smart logistics networks is key to the success of NLP. Alongside, policymakers and industry stakeholders must continue to pursue the cause for holistic logistics with steely determination.
Steel industry as a key enabler of “holistic logistics”
India’s logistics market is on an upward trajectory. The sector is considered key to realising India’s aspiration to become a $5-trillion economy over the next few years.
Steel products
and
steel metal suppliers
will likely see significant traction in the market. Downstream MSMEs are also expected to contribute significantly to the country’s economic boom. Preferential pricing, just-in-time supplies, and other initiatives will help MSMEs get a head-start in the market. Besides, these businesses might require training, development, and hand-holding services from time to time. Mindful of this, MSMEs often prefer to work with upstream steel suppliers who are willing to devote sufficient bandwidth to them.


At JSW, we have also been chipping in to help realise the full potential of holistic logistics as envisioned by the government. For instance, JSW Steel is a major

1MXjjjxdfZyovOjdFFfUex,Why trade credit is necessary for the steel industry,N/A,N/A,Business,,,why-trade-credit-is-necessary-for-the-steel-industry,2021-11-23T05:31:55.324Z,2021-12-10T06:32:54.834Z,3 minutes,"How does trade credit benefit the steel industry and MSMEs, especially during the pandemic.
Key Takeaways:
• Trade credit is an essential part of doing business, regardless of sector
• It allows different players in the value chain to seamlessly do business without the need to raise short-term finance
• In sectors like steel, where the cycle from purchasing the raw material to realising payment on the finished product is long, trade credit is a boon, especially for small businesses
No matter what business you are in, some of your transactions are probably on credit. If you are a manufacturer, you may be buying your raw materials on credit, and your clients are most likely taking your finished product on credit. Trade credit lubricates the engines of economic activity by giving downstream partners the time to create products and realize the value of those products from end customers.
At a basic level, trade credit is simply an arrangement that lets buyers take the goods they need from sellers without paying cash up front. Depending on your business and arrangement with your suppliers, you could get credit ranging from 30 to 90 days. But just as you get to enjoy the fruits of credit, your downstream partners such as clients and customers would expect a similar courtesy.
In the face of strict lockdowns and restrictions on movement following the outbreak of the pandemic, several industries faced contractions, including the steel industry. While the industry is showing signs of recovery in 2021, many enterprises, especially MSMEs, are relying on trade credit to get through this trying time.
The formal sector does not lend easily to small businesses. Without access to short-term credit from banks and financial institutions, small businesses often resort to borrowings at high interest rates, which eats into their margins and profits. The pandemic-induced lockdowns and the consequent demand contraction have made matters worse as many of them are saddled with unsold inventory.
Trade credit works on trust and relationship-building. Yes, most enterprises have contracts and agreements, but the system works best when there’s a rapport and understanding between the supplier and manufacture and the customer.
Other short-term financing options
Trade credit is the first resort for short-term financing because in most cases it has no interest or cost attached as it involves no paperwork, is based on trust and is easy to avail. But trade credit does have some drawbacks. The same raw material can be bought at a lower price if bought with cash and trade credit markups are oftentimes opaque and high. Thus, if the arrangement isn’t a fair and transparent one, trade credit can become quite expensive for an enterprise.
Businesses often need to resort to other financing options too to meet their short-term needs. These include business loans or an overdraft facility. Apart from these, the most common option is receivables financing.
Receivables are all the payments that are due to a company in the future. And raising money against your receivables is called receivables financing.
One of the most popular types of receivable financing is bill discounting. What is bill discounting?
Let’s say you are a manufacturer and have sold goods to customer A and have raised a bill or invoice. Customer A has a trade credit with you of 60 days. But you need funds to buy more raw materials and can’t wait till A’s payment comes in. You can, however, use your invoices to A to raise money from a bank or financial institution. In simple terms, the bank pays you a discounted amount in advance and collects the entire amount from customer A. Let’s say, the value of your invoice is Rs 1.10 lakh. The bank will pay you Rs 1 lakh against the invoice. And then collect Rs 1.10 lakh from customer A when the payment becomes due.
Receivables financing allows businesses to immediately deploy money that is due to them at a later date into productive activity.
Differences between trade credit and receivable financing
Trade Credit:
• An agreement between B2B buyer and seller
• Allows a business to buy now and pay later
• Usually, no interest is involved. Credit mark ups and related cost are opaque
R
eceivables financing:
• An agreement between a businesses and a lender
• Allows a seller to collect money against payments that are due later
• Comes at a cost -- interest or discount

Steel has come a long way since it was first mass produced in the mid-1850s, and it continues to maintain its utility as a material of choice in a wide range of industries.
As for the automotive industry, the wonder alloy is simply indispensable. So, what makes steel so essential to automakers? Almost 60-65% of a typical modern vehicle is made up of steel. The skeletal body, panels, doors and trunk closures consume the biggest chunk of it. The engine block, gears, the suspension, fuel tank, wheels, tyres, and steering and braking systems take up the remainder of the steel used in the making of a vehicle. In other words, an automobile is covered in steel from the hood to the bumper.

Steel’s versatility
Steel has many qualities that have endeared itself to automobile manufactures for nearly a century now. An alloy of primarily iron and carbon, steel has earned an enviable reputation for its strength, durability, dependability, elasticity and ability to resist corrosion. This versatility coupled with a low production cost vis-à-vis other materials and immense scope for innovation makes steel the backbone of the automotive industry.

The sustainable angle
Steel’s sustainability is one of the primary reasons why it continues to be a material of choice now and in the future for the automotive industry. Two factors explain steel’s high sustainability – it is made up of iron, one of the most abundant elements on earth, and it is hundred per cent recyclable. In other words, steel once produced can be used forever. You can recycle it over and over again, and it will not lose its primary properties. This unique quality to retain its characteristic even after recycling makes steel the one of the only materials that can be recycled back into the same product.
Steel is today the most recycled industrial material in the world.

Innovation and technological advancements
The steel producers working for the automotive sector have to be on their toes when it comes to innovation to meet the challenges of the industry and demands of their consumers. This has resulted in constant innovation and technological upgradation.
Over the past few decades, the steel industry has been employing a range of innovative technologies and improving existing steel grades to reduce the environmental impact of steel production.
Besides, steel manufacturers are also finding ways to clean up their production process to meet increasingly stringent environmental protection regulations across the globe.
Steel companies have been investing heavily in research and development. This R&D spending has resulted in tapping the amazing power of steel. Consequently, today there are more than 3,500 grades of steel with many different physical and environmental properties and chemical compositions, all designed to meet the specific needs of end users.

Quest for greener, lighter, stronger steels
Of late, steel makers’ quest for greener and cleaner steel has resulted in the development and commercialisation of uniquely lightweight Advanced High-Strength Steels (AHSS). These are ultra strong but lighter steel products designed to meet the stringent safety regulations, reduce emissions and deliver performance – all at affordable costs.
These sophisticated products help automakers significantly decrease a vehicle’s structural weight and cut its total life cycle CO2 emissions more than any other automotive material.
The use of cutting-edge technologies has resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of energy used for steel production today. It has also cut down dust emissions in a big way.

Challenges and the future of steel
The urgency to make their vehicles lighter has made car manufacturers explore use of aluminium, magnesium steel alloys, carbon fiber and polymer composites. But all these materials, although lighter than ordinary steel, come at much higher costs. Besides, there are issues related to formability,  recyclability, and multi-material complications in joining, painting and after-accident repairs.
Steel uses much lower amounts of energy in production and scores over other materials on recyclability. Because of its intrinsic properties, recycling steel is simpler and cheaper than recycling aluminium.
These factors make innovative steel products like AHSS one of the most appealing options for automakers. Most industry watchers agree that steel will continue to be a critical component in cars because of its strength, affordability and versatility."

Both exhibit distinct characteristics that make them suitable for diverse applications. While zeroing in on a rolled steel material for a specific project, it is essential to be aware of the primary differences between these two types and how effective their performance is.
Hot rolled steel
Hot Rolled stee
l
is basically steel that has successfully undergone the process of rolling at a temperature that is above its recrystallisation temperature (up to or exceeding 1700° F). In comparison with unprocessed steel, the processed material demonstrates enhanced workability and formability, making it much easier to work within processing operations.
The process of hot rolling begins with a large and rectangular slab of metal known as a billet. Initially, the billet is heated and subsequently compressed into a large roll. While still hot, it eventually passes through a series of rotating rollers to attain the desired dimensions. When it comes to operations of sheet metal production, the rolled steel is further wound into coiled rollers and then left to cool. Regarding product operations that involve other forms, the processed material is efficiently cut into specified units and then packaged.
Benefits Of Hot Rolled steel
• Lower Costs
• Enhanced Workability
• Minimal to No Internal Stress
Applications of Hot Rolled steel
• Construction Materials (such as I-beams)
• Railroad Equipment (tracks and components of railcars)
• Automobile parts (such as wheel rims and frames)
• Agricultural Equipment
Cold Rolled Steel
Cold Rolled steel

is basically hot rolled steel that has undergone further processing to enhance its mechanical and dimensional properties. During the process of cold rolling, hot rolled steel that has been cooled passes through an additional series of rollers at room temperature. Because the material is no longer malleable and hot, a higher amount of pressure is needed to successfully compress it into the desired shape. This process reduces the ductility of the cold rolled steel making it tough for framing operations. So, to recover the ductility, this steel undergoes the annealing process. The is a heat treatment the relieves the stress on the metal during the cold rolling procedure and increase ductility.
While this specific process is much more labour intensive and costly in comparison with the hot rolling process, it can ultimately achieve tighter dimensional tolerances and enhanced surface qualities.
When it comes to Hot Rolled vs Cold Rolled steel,

the benefits of the latter include:
• Superior Strength
• Enhanced Surface Finishes
• Greater Precision
Applications Of Cold Rolled steel
• Mechanical Components
• Metal Furniture
• Rods, Strips, Sheets, and Bars
• Home Appliances
• Aerospace structures
Key differences between Hot Rolled steel And Cold Rolled steel
As indicated earlier, the primary difference between Hot Rolled and Cold Rolled steel

is the temperature at which they need to be processed. Hot Rolled steel is rolled above the recrystallisation temperature of the material, whereas cold rolled steel is rolled below the recrystallisation temperature of the material. Besides this quality, there are some other distinctions between the two materials, which are mentioned below:
• Surface Quality
Hot rolled steel has the tendency to have rough surfaces and edges, which need decarburisation or other specific treatments to eventually prepare it for use in production operations. In contrast, Cold Rolled steel tends to have a smooth and shiny surface that permits it to be used as-is in diverse product operations.
• Material Hardness
The process of cold rolling produces steel with much-enhanced hardness and strength in comparison with steel produced by the process of hot rolling.
• Internal Stress
The enhanced hardness and material strength produced by the process of cold rolling come with greater internal stresses. These stresses need to be relieved prior to processing of the material, failing which the final product or part may experience warping.
These two primary types of steel must not be confused with the grades or technical specifications that are used for the classification of steel based on physical characteristics and composition. Steel can be hot or cold rolled irrespective of its grade or metallurgical specifications.
The Final Word:
While considering steel options for a specific project, it is crucial to remember that some materials will work in a much better way in comparison with others for certain purposes. Knowing which type of steel offers the most ideal properties for a given application can successfully prevent overspending on raw materials and save precious time in the long run."

Article at a glance:
• A good CMR (between 4 and 1) can give MSMEs access to affordable credit
• Lenders use CMR to evaluate the credit-worthiness of finance seekers
• It is also possible for business owners to fund businesses in a personal capacity via CIBIL scores
You may have heard of the term credit rating or the CIBIL score, which banks use to evaluate the credit-worthiness of individual borrowers. Just as the CIBIL score is a rating of loan-takers, CMR (CIBIL MSME rank) is an assessment of the credit-worthiness of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
Understanding CIBIL MSME Rank (CMR)
CMR assigns a grade to small and medium businesses based on their credit profile, repayment behaviour and future repayment capacity. A score towards the lower end of the scale shows greater credit-worthiness. Banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) use CMR to evaluate loan applications from MSMEs.
The CIBIL MSME Rank rates businesses on a scale of 1 to 10, with CMR-1 indicating minimum risk of default and CMR-10 indicating the highest risk. CMR is assigned only to companies that have an overall outstanding credit of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 50 crore.
Why is CMR important for an MSME?
Banks and financial institutions are often wary of lending to MSMEs without collateral because they fear defaults. CMR is an objective model or criteria to assess the credit risk of an MSME. A low CMR indicates that an MSME has a good repayment track record and practices prudent credit behaviour. This helps lenders reduce their credit risk and extend finance to deserving applicants.
For MSMEs, a low CMR improves access to quick and affordable credit. Many leading banks offer a lower rate of interest to MSMEs with a low CMR.
How can you check your company's CMR?
Follow the steps below to check your company’s CMR:
• Visit the website: https://www.cibil.com/online/Company-credit-report.do
• Fill in necessary details: name and address of the company, contact details of the company and applicant, PAN number etc
• Pay the registration fee (around INR 3000)
• CIBIL will mail you a unique Registration ID and Transaction ID. Use the registration ID to access the next steps
• Upload KYC documents
How do you improve your CMR?
Improving CMR requires that a few measures are undertaken by businesses:
1. Bill payments need to be made on time - just as it would be in the case of individuals, any outstanding debt or credit card payments for businesses need to be paid consistently on time.
2. Lower credit utilisation - A safe bet as far as credit utilisation is concerned is to keep the ratio under 30%. Even if larger sums are available to the business, not actively seeking it will benefit your business. However, if you do take on more debt, pay it back on time. This will help your credit score recover in the long run.
3. Clear old debt first - Before taking on additional debt, clearing the original debt should be prioritised. Too many outstanding loans may scare off lenders.
4. Consider taking a short-term loan - After all your outstanding debt has been cleared, a short-term loan should be availed. If you repay this loan on time, it should help your credit score rise as it proves your capacity to repay the loan.
5. Safeguard old credit cards - Older credit cards and timely bill payments indicate stability and help you boost your credit score.
6. Report mistakes - Simple mistakes such as the wrong mobile number, or spelling errors could lower your score. By checking your reports periodically, you can help identify these errors and rectify your credit score.
Final note
: Enhancing a credit score may seem easy, but doing so takes a significant amount of time. For businesses that have a reasonably strong score, enhancing it is a good idea. It provides quick access to funding, and lenders are often happy to part with funds at better terms For those that have a higher CMR, the road to better funding might seem long, but taking steps to remedy the situation is definitely worthwhile.

In 2017 alone, as reported by World Steel in association with Oxford Economics, the steel industry sold over USD 2.5 trillion worth of products and created a staggering USD 500 billion worth of net value-add. However, what has been questioned time and again, is the environmental impact the industry holds.
Despite the fact that steel is one of the most recyclable materials in the world, with the capability to last almost forever, several existing methods of steel production have countless negative impacts on the environment. This includes the emission of hazardous gases into the atmosphere, waterbody contamination, production of solid waste or by-products, and more. The present methods of manufacturing steel involves the use of coal almost exclusively to eliminate oxygen from the iron ore. This process of oxygen removal creates enormous amounts of CO2 or carbon dioxide at the end of the process chain. This is one of the major environmental concerns associated with the steel industry and this has forced the industry to research and pour their resources into more sustainable solutions.
Steel Industry’s Commitment To Tackle Environmental Concerns
The Indian steel industry committed to the 2015 Paris Agreement: to cut emissions intensity per unit GDP by 33% to 35%, by 2030, to help reduce the global temperature. In addition, it has also started its transition towards low-carbon growth to abide by the national climate change priorities.
Globally, several other industry giants have invested in research and technology to discover new and greener methods of steel production. This will also create new grades of high-strength and high-quality steel. With time and advancements in technology, the industry will considerably minimize its negative impact on the environment.
Greener Steel Variants: Telling Them Apart
The steel industry is striving to make steel manufacturing an eco-friendly and sustainable process. However, in an industry this big adultery and manipulation of terms are bound to happen. Therefore, it is pivotal that the terms are clearly understood.
Green Steel:
The term ‘Green Steel’ may sound eco-friendly but its meaning is interpreted differently. The term is heavily used in the context of marketing as consumers are looking for environmentally conscious products. The term has been in close associations with steel that has been manufactured using world-class technology, steel that has been reused and produced from scrap, and also conventional steel that minimizes the emissions of CO2.
With so many meanings the end consumer can be misled, therefore, it’s important to ask and research which ‘green steel’ is being brought before purchase.
Zero-carbon Steel:
In order to be rightfully termed as zero-carbon, the steel produced would need to be produced with absolutely no emission of carbon dioxide. However, the bar is extremely tough to reach and practically unachievable as residual emission can arise at several points of the production. Apart from that, steel must contain some amount of carbon because only then will it be different from its ore.
If the manufacturer manages to balance the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted by taking out the emissions from the atmosphere by sinks; the produced steel will then be referred to as carbon-neutral steel or net-zero steel.
Fossil-free Steel:
Fossil-free steel is relatively, a new discovery in the steel industry. Instead of coal, it’s made with hydrogen. Fossil-free steel is produced with zero usage of fossil fuels like coal or natural gas, making it, virtually, carbon neutral. While this has been created and recreated successfully, it will require more R&D before the product becomes commonly used and made.
Carbon-free Steel:
Low carbon steel or fossil-free steel are two terms that are interchangeable with the word carbon-free steel. Essentially, they refer to the same thing.
Several, global steel manufacturing organisations have successfully, or are in the process, of moving towards a greener steel. At this point in time, the most common way is through cutting toxic emissions by a large percent.
How Sustainable Is Steel?
While steel does contribute, a certain extent, to the global carbon emissions, are there any sustainable aspects to the material? The answer is: absolutely. Steel is one of the most recyclable materials on the planet. Steel scraps, through simple processes can be recovered and reused. Due to this, and the fact that it's one of the safest, cleanest materials used in construction, steel has earned itself several green certification: IGCC, LEED, and more. Steel may not be renewable, but it is recyclable.
Apart from this, there are several other factors that go into the distribution of steel, packaging is one such example. Today, several steel companies offer recyclable or biodegradable packaging for their products. Some organisations also donate sizeable amounts of their profits towards offsetting the carbon footprint caused by the transportation of steel: a very do-able contribution towards the environment.
While the transition towards sustainable practices in the steel industry is a slow one, it’s a trend and necessity that’s definitely on the rise. Global governments, hand-in-hand with steel giants across the world are definitely emerging as pioneers in the sustainable steel industry."

Let’s look at these interesting steelmaking process steps.
1. Producing iron
Iron ore, when mined, is a combination of iron with oxygen and several other unwanted substances, which are known as gangue. To produce pure steel, the products that are involved in the steel making process (such as iron ore, coke and lime) must be converted into iron. All these raw materials are placed in a blast furnace and Corex furnace and further melted down to produce hot metal or molten iron. Besides bulk iron ore, prepared burden (such as sinter and pellets) is also fed into the furnace. At this point too, the iron contains several impurities, which need to be removed to make sure that the metal is not brittle. To achieve this, metallic iron is then passed to the steelmaking process as a liquid at nearly 1450°C. This iron is known as hot metal or pig iron.
2. Primary steelmaking
During the process of refining iron to produce steel, the carbon content of hot metal is successfully lowered, generally to less than 1% through an oxidation process in a BOF or Basic Oxygen Steelmaking Furnace. Post completion of this, alloys are added to the furnace to attain the needed chemical composition of the end product in a Ladle Refining Furnace. The content of chemicals is controlled very meticulously during this stage. Previously, most steels were produced through processes such as the bessemer and open Hearth. But these have now been replaced by ultramodern processes such as basic oxygen steelmaking. To remove all impurities, the molten metal is further infused with scrap steel. Oxygen too will be forced through the furnace, which gets rid of carbon and several other impurities. When it comes to electric furnaces, electricity needs to be forced through the furnace, achieving identical results. De-gassing is the ultimate step in steelmaking, wherein all the gaseous particles are eventually removed in the presence of a vacuum atmosphere. After completion of this process, we now have raw steel.
3. Secondary steelmaking
The different grades of available steel are used for different purposes. The grading depends on which elements are still present in the metal, such as carbon dioxide. Most of the carbon will be eventually removed, but it will be substituted by aluminium to produce drawing quality steel. To produce structural steel, additional carbon is left inside, and this imparts greater tensile strength to the steel. Specific techniques can be successfully implemented to change the level of impurities left behind, including stirring, increasing or decreasing the temperature, removing all gasses and ladle injection. When this process is complete and the right grade has been accomplished, the next step can be carried about.
4. Continual casting
In this step, molten steel is cast into cooling moulds. This enables hardening of the steel, following which the steel is drawn out while it is still hot. Guided rollers are then used to pull it out. The steel is then accurately cut into the needed lengths. This steel can be then used to produce billets, beams and slabs, among others. When the parts are completely cooled, they are then sent for a further rolling process known as primary forging.
5. Primary forging
During this process, the rough-cast items are precisely formed into the desired shapes through hot rolling, which gets rid of any defects in the shape and delivers the desired quality levels. The cast steel can be efficiently rolled in successive steps to produce one of the many desired shapes of steel. Of all the shaping methods, rolling is the most common. The precise amount of work to which steel is subjected to along with the temperature during rolling will significantly determine its physical characteristics - whether the steel can successfully be bent, cut, machined, or formed into pipes, tubes or wires. The process of hot rolling can be used to produce seamless tubing, a wide range of bespoke items, and long and flat products. Rolled steel that is produced from slabs is known as flat steel products whereas that produced from billets/blooms is known as long steel products.
6. Secondary forging
To accomplish the final desired shape of steel, there are numerous secondary techniques that can be put into practice such as coating, thermal treating, joining, pressing, drilling, machining and riveting.
This is the entire journey of steel from start to finish.
Let’s now look at some of the diverse types of steel products.
• Flat steel products
Flat steel is further categorised into three primary types based on the type of process involved: (1) Hot Rolled Steel (HR), (2) Cold Rolled Steel (CR), and (3) Coated Steel.
To produce hot rolled steel products, slabs will be thoroughly rolled in a Hot Strip Mill or HSM. The relative plasticity of steel at temperatures that fall between 800°C and 1200°C (which is above the recrystallisation temperature) makes it possible to successfully roll steel into a wide range of useful shapes, while simultaneously enhancing its mechanical properties. Usually, the more the steel is hot rolled, the tougher and denser it becomes. HR Coil ranges from 1.6-25 mm in thickness and is produced in HSM. HR coils are further processed into HR plates as well as Hot Rolled Pickled and Oiled Coils/Plates (HRPO) based on the requirements.
The HR coil is eventually uncoiled and cleaned or pickled, in an acid-containing long tank. This process successfully removes the blue/black oxide and scales from the surface. After this, the steel is rinsed and trimmed before making its way to the cold reduction mill. The clean pickled coil’s leading end is then fed through a set of rolls and then, onto a recoiler. Cold reduction mills comprise up to 6 stands, and a majority are of the four-high variety. Through a combination of extremely high roll force and strip tension, the thickness of the steel is reduced at each stand progressively. The pickling and cold reduction are continuous processes. Post pickling, the strips are joined from end to end before they are passed through the reduction stands. Post cold rolling, the steel may be annealed or tempered to improve its metallurgical properties.
Coating on steel enhances corrosion resistance as well as the aesthetic value of the final product. Coated steel is further classified based on the type of coating process that is involved. These are tin coated steel, Galvanised (GI), Galvalume (GL), Galvannealed (GA), Pre-Painted Galvalume (PPGL), and Pre-Painted Galvanised (PPGI).
• Long steel products
Long steel products are manufactured from billets or blooms in the hot rolling process. These mills differ significantly from flat products mills in the fact that the rolls that are used for bars and wire-rod products are profiled. In most cases, several passes are needed to produce the final shape. Several types of alloy steel are produced in the bars and wire-rod form. The technologies used are High Yield Quenched and Self Tempered to produce TMT rebars and ultimately ensure superior quality as well as sustainable products.
We will now look at some of the innovative technologies to minimise the environmental impact when it comes to the production of steel.
• HYBRIT process
The goal of using HYBRIT or Hydrogen Breakthrough Ironmaking Technology is to produce zero-carbon in the process of steel production. This new-generation procedure uses hydrogen, which can remove oxygen present in the iron ore. Yet, the outcome is water vapour and not carbon dioxide. This leads to the formation of green steel.
• Jet process
One of the latest technologies when it comes to exceptional converters is the Jet Process. Because of this advancement, a wide scope of scrap rates can be successfully handled in a highly profitable way. The Jet Process is an innovative technique for the amplification of scrap rates and HBI (Hot Briquetted Direct Reduced Iron) rates when it comes to converter steelmaking.
• Molten oxide electrolysis
Molten Oxide Electrolysis is an unorthodox electrometallurgical system that makes it possible for quick production of metal from oxide raw material to the liquid state. It ensures significant simplification of the entire process and minimisation of essential energy needs.
The last word
The journey of steel from the initial raw materials right up to the finished product is quite fascinating. That said, it can take a toll on the environment, making it necessary to work towards eco-friendly and sustainable ways in the process of steel production. JSW Steel is committed to manufacturing sustainable and environment-friendly steel, increasingly in the future.

Key takeaways:

• ECLGS offers 100% guaranteed coverage against defaults to banks and NBFCs who extend emergency credit to MSMEs
• The Rs 3-lakh-crore scheme has helped incentivise member lending institutions (MLIs) to provide low-cost credit to MSMEs for their short-term operational needs.
• The scheme has been extended to 30.09.2021 or till the guarantees for an amount of Rs.3 lakh crore are issued. The disbursement under the scheme is also permitted up to 31.12.2021(1).
ECLGS stands for Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme. Under this, the government of India offers banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) 100% guarantee against defaults on the emergency credit they extend to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
The Rs 3-lakh-crore scheme was launched last year to help the MSME sector raise emergency finance to tide over the crisis induced by the pandemic. By providing a 100% guarantee, Through ECLGS, the Government aims to incentivise member lending institutions (MLIs) to provide low-cost credit to MSMEs for their short-term operational needs.
The emergency credit scheme has been revised and extended through ECLGS 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 The scheme’s validity has been extended until September 30, 2021, and the last date of disbursement of funds has been set as December 31, 2021
ECLGS interest rate and other features
MSMEs can get a term loan at an interest rate of 14% per annum under ECLGS. The loan is available only to existing customers of MLIs without any additional collateral. Other features include: zero processing fees and zero prepayment or foreclosure charges.
As an MSME you can get a term loan at fixed or floating interest rate. The interest rate has been capped at 9.25% for banks and 14% for NBFCs. The loan is available to existing customers of MLIs without the need for additional collateral with many MLIs even incentivising customers via lucrative offers.
Who is covered under the scheme?
All MSMEs set up as proprietorships, partnerships, registered companies, trusts and limited liability partnerships (LLPs), interested borrowers under the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY), and individuals who have taken loans for business.
All about ECLGS 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0
ECLGS 1.0: Under ECLGS 1.0, MSMEs could borrow additional funds of up to 20% of their outstanding credit as of February 29, 2020. The credit facility under ECLGS 1.0 came with a tenure of 4 years and a moratorium of 1 year. MSMEs with outstanding loans of up to Rs 25 crore and Rs 100 crore in turnover were eligible under ECLGS 1.0.
ECLGS 2.0:  ECLGS 2.0 extended cover to 26 stressed sectors identified by the Kamath Committee. 2.0 also increased the loan tenure to 5 years with a one-year moratorium. It removed the turnover cap and all businesses with an outstanding credit of Rs 50 crore-Rs 500 crore (as of February 29, 2020) were made eligible.
ECLGS 3.0: The latest version covers stressed service sectors like hospitality, travel & tourism, leisure and sporting. MSMEs can get additional credit of up to 40% of the total outstanding amount. 3.0 extends the tenure of loans to 6 years, with a moratorium of 2 years.
Eligibility criteria for MSMEs to get credit under ECLGS(2)
:
• All MSMEs with combined outstanding loans of up to Rs 50 crore (across all lenders) in any sector and up to Rs 500 crore for borrowers in the hospitality, travel and tourism, leisure and sporting sectors (as on February 29, 2020).
• All MSME borrowers in the 26 sectors identified by the Kamath Committee and in the healthcare sector with outstanding loans of more than Rs 50 crore and not exceeding Rs 500 crore across all lenders (as on February 29, 2020).
• To be eligible, the MSME must be a customer of an MLI and have GST registration (unless GST registration is not required for the business).
• Individuals who have taken loans for business
The Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme has provided much needed low-cost credit to MSMEs. However, with the pandemic still in full-swing and a third wave expected in India, the impact on businesses around the country could be severe. Similar initiatives will be needed to ensure the long-term survival and eventual growth of MSMEs. Incentivising equity investments from the general public, prioritizing access to funding for MSMEs, and tax-friendly policies from the legislature could be the key to reviving the industry.

Here is a list of MSME financing options:
• Asset-based finance
• Equity financing
• Venture capital and angel investors
• Peer-to-peer lending
A major requirement for running most businesses is access to finance and credit. For micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) the struggle to get funding is all too real. Issues with working capital, supply-chain, labour shortages etc. are often caused by a lack of access to funds.
In India, loans from banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and micro-finance institutions (MFIs) are the traditional go-to finance options for small businesses. Many businesses also resort to slightly different funding routes at different stages of the growth cycle. In the early stages, they rely on personal funds, bank loans, and funds from friends and family for their funding needs. The Increased dependence on debt finance, followed by a mix of various new-age options such as crowd-funding and accelerators takes place in the growth and sustenance phases.
In this blog, we try to delve into the different financing avenues available to MSMEs.
Debt financing:
There is a clear preference among MSMEs towards debt financing in India. Loans are taken by firms from banks and financial institutions, often under various government schemes that aim to handhold MSMEs.
However, the debt finance landscape for MSMEs is changing. There is a gradual transition towards digital products and services. New-age digital-first fintech companies are making debt finance available to businesses in even the most remote parts of the country. Fully-digital (paper-free) processes, and rapid disbursal (within 24 hours with some providers) provide strong alternatives to traditional bank loans. Going to a bank for a loan is no longer a necessity. Just personal, business and bank details can provide access to funding overnight.
Secured Loans:
Business assets act as collateral with asset-based, secured loans. Many banks offer business loans to steel manufacturers and distributors against machinery or property that they own. Loans can also be provided against accounts receivable, inventory levels and real estate.
Equity financing:
A much-neglected area for MSMEs in India, equity financing allows organisations to raise capital against shares issued by them. Investors who purchase large numbers of these shares may also provide access to business contacts, other sources to capital and even management expertise to help the business grow.  Technology companies and the startup ecosystem have shown that equity funding can quickly ramp up business and capacity, leading to incredible growth.
Venture capital (VC) and angel investors:
Stage-wise funding needs of MSMEs can be met via venture capital and angel investments. VC, angel investors, and high net-worth individuals (HNIs), invest in early-stages or developing businesses with scalable models. Cold-emails (direct email without the right introductions) and cold-calling might seem like a good idea. However, the chances of success are low. The best way to get in touch with either VCs or angel investors is via a personal referral and introduction.
In the past, funding a business required either immense wealth or the ability to take on traditional forms of debt. This is no longer the case. Digital solutions, technological innovations and cutting-edge finance products are providing the framework for the growth of MSMEs in India. It is now time for Indian MSMEs to step up and deliver on their underlying potential.

It would surely not be wrong to refer to them as the backbone of the country.
The Indian Government has introduced MSME in agreement with the MSME Development (MSMED) Act of 2006. These enterprises are primarily engaged in the production, manufacture, processing, or preservation of goods as well as commodities.
MSMEs are a vital sector for the country’s economy and have contributed immensely to India’s socio-economic development. Besides generating employment opportunities, they work efficiently towards the development of India’s rural and backward areas. According to the Government’s annual report (2018-2019), there are nearly 6,08,41,245 MSMEs in the country.
MSMEs Redefined
According to the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development (Amendment) Bill (2018), MSMEs were classified as service-providing or manufacturing enterprises based on their annual turnover.
Based on the new definitions, MSME units will be now classified as below:
Micro Enterprises: Turnover of less than 5 crore with an investment of less than 1 crore
Small Enterprises: Turnover of less than 50 crore with an investment of less than 10 crore
Medium Enterprises: Turnover of less than 250 crore with an investment of less than 50 crore
Benefits Of The Reclassification
According to the new classification, there will not be any need for frequent inspection to verify the investment in plant and machinery. In addition, the operations of MSMEs will be completely transparent and non-discriminatory, while being objective in nature.
Role Of MSMEs In Indian Economy
Since inception, the MSME sector has proven to be an extremely dynamic sector when it comes to the Indian economy. MSMEs manufacture and produce a wide range of items for both the domestic and international markets. They have helped in the promotion of growth and development of khadi, coir, and village industries. They have successfully collaborated and worked with all concerned ministries, stakeholders, and state governments, towards the upbringing of rural regions.
MSMEs have played a key role in providing job opportunities in rural areas. They have tremendously helped in the industrialisation of these regions with a low capital cost in comparison with large industries. Serving as a complementary unit to larger sectors, the MSME sector has phenomenally contributed to socio-economic development.
MSMEs are also contributing and playing a crucial role in India’s development in diverse areas such as requirement of low investment, flexibility when it comes to operations, mobility through locations, low range of imports, and a vast contribution to domestic production.
MSMEs have the capacity and capability to develop efficient local technology, provide intense competition in both domestic as well as international markets, create defence material, and generate new entrepreneurs by imparting training, knowledge, and skill-upgradation through specialised training centres.
Why are MSMEs Important For The Indian Economy?
Throughout the world, MSMEs are regarded as a vital means of economic growth in addition to promoting equitable development. They are considered to generate the highest rate of economic growth. MSMEs have taken India to new heights via requirements of considerably low investments, flexible operations, and the ability to develop the requisite native technology.
• MSMEs employ nearly 120 million individuals, becoming the second-largest, employment-generating sector after agriculture.
• With nearly 45 lakh units throughout India, they contribute as much as 6.11% of the GDP from the manufacturing arena and 24.63% of the GDP from the service arena.
• MSME ministry has set a target to increase MSME contribution to GDP by as much as 50% by the year 2025, while the country moves ahead to successfully become a $5 trillion economy.
• MSMEs contribute to approximately 45% of the overall country’s exports.
• They help in promoting all-inclusive growth by offering employment opportunities, especially to individuals who belong to the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society.
• MSMEs located in tier-2 and tier-3 cities help in the creation of opportunities for individuals to exclusively use banking products and services, which can eventually amount to the final inclusion of MSME contribution to Indian economy.
• MSMEs help promote innovation by offering opportunities to budding entrepreneurs to assist them in building creative products, thereby boosting competition in business and fuelling economic growth.
The Last Word:
The MSME sector in India offers silent support to the country’s economy, but the sector also needs some kind of support from other businesses as only government support isn’t enough for them to thrive. With the support from other bigger businesses, the MSME sector can boost and act as a reliable defence against global economic adversities and shocks.
