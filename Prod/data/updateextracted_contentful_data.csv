According to the Indian Steel Association (ISA, 2023), HDG steel is up to 40% more corrosion-resistant than pre-galvanised alternatives.

2. Optimising frame design for structural integrity

A well-engineered frame design enhances load distribution and wind resistance. To achieve optimal performance:

Use C-channel and square tube profiles for maximum rigidity.

Ensure minimum steel thickness of 1.5-2 mm for durability.

Incorporate cross-bracing and reinforcement to withstand high wind loads, especially in coastal regions.

3. Precision cutting and welding techniques

To maintain the integrity of galvanised coatings during fabrication:

Use laser cutting or CNC plasma cutting to ensure precision without compromising the protective zinc layer.

Employ low-heat welding techniques (e.g., MIG welding) to reduce zinc evaporation, preventing weak points in the frame structure.

4. Anti-corrosion treatment post-fabrication

Even though galvanised steel is naturally corrosion-resistant, additional protective treatments enhance longevity:

Apply zinc-rich paint or cold galvanising spray on cut and welded areas to restore corrosion protection.

Click here now!",Product,3 minutes,tips-for-ensuring-high-quality-cement-plastering-work,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"When it comes to constructing or renovating a building, the finishing touches play a vital role in determining the overall aesthetics and durability of the structure. One of these crucial finishing touches is plastering. Properly executed

cement plastering

can transform a rough, uneven wall into a smooth, uniform surface ready for painting and decorating. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into cement plastering and explore the steps to ensure excellence.

The significance of plastering
Before we dive into the checklist and guidelines for achieving high-quality cement plastering, it's important to understand why this step is so crucial in the construction or renovation of a building. Plastering serves several essential purposes:

1. Surface protection

Plastering provides a protective layer over the underlying structure, whether brick walls, concrete surfaces, or composite metal surfaces. This layer shields the surface from water penetration, weathering, and other atmospheric influences. Without proper plastering, these surfaces are susceptible to damage and deterioration.

2. Aesthetic appeal

Plastering is more than just a protective measure; it also adds to the structure's visual appeal. It covers up the wall's undulations, cracks, and imperfections, creating a smooth and aesthetically pleasing canvas for further interior or exterior work, such as painting or decorative finishes.

3. Uniformity

Plastering ensures that the wall surface is uniform and consistent. It covers up any discrepancies in the underlying structure, providing a clean and level foundation for other design elements.

4. Durability

Quality plastering is resistant to cracks and other forms of damage, ensuring that your walls remain in excellent condition for years to come.

Now that we understand the importance of plastering let's delve into the checklist and guidelines for achieving excellence in

cement

plastering work.

Pre-plastering checklist

1. Surface preparation

Surface preparation is the foundation of a successful plastering job. Here are the key steps to consider:

Cleaning: Ensure that the surface is clean and free from loose particles, dust, and debris. You can achieve this by washing the exterior, scraping off loose material, or using a wire brush.

Roughness: To enhance adhesion, create a rough surface on brick walls. You can achieve this by raking the wall. For smooth concrete surfaces, hacking is necessary to promote good adhesion.

Surface evenness: The surface should be free of undulations to minimise the thickness of the plaster. Uneven surfaces can result in variations in plaster thickness.

Discontinuity of surfaces: Discontinuities in plastered surfaces can lead to cracks. For instance, transitions from concrete to brick surfaces or clay brick to cement blocks should be addressed by providing a layer of plastering mesh at the junction to prevent crack formation.

2. Curing

Proper curing is essential to achieve maximum strength and density in the plaster. After the application has hardened and is no longer susceptible to damage, it should be kept damp for at least seven days. Curing can be done by spraying water on the surface or using wet gunny bags.

3. Specification and standards

Sand sieving: Sieve the sand per specifications and grade to ensure its quality.

Mortar mix: The proportion of cement mortar should adhere to industry standards. A 1:4 mix is typically used for ceilings and a 1:6 combination for walls.

Water quality: The water used in plastering should be suitable for drinking and free from chlorides and organic impurities.

4. Check levels and undulations

Button marks: Button marking is a technique used to mark the wall surface before plastering to ensure that the plaster is applied evenly and at the correct thickness.

Undulations: Check for smooth finishes using spirit levels to identify any undulations, cracks, or irregularities in horizontal and vertical directions.

Halogen lights: Utilise yellow halogen lights to detect undulations on the surface. These lights can reveal imperfections that can be rectified while the mortar is still fresh.

During plastering checklist

Bullheads and thickness levels: Prepare bullheads and check thickness and levels during plastering to maintain consistency.

Proper mixing: Ensure that cement, sand, and water are mixed properly to create a uniform and waste-minimised mixture. Mixing should be done in a metal pan to avoid contamination from the ground or soil.

After plastering checklist

Curing: Begin curing as soon as the plaster has hardened to ensure maximum strength and prevent cracks. A minimum of seven days of curing is recommended for plastered surfaces.

Grooves: After plastering the outer walls, cut grooves to prevent cracks caused by temperature differences. These grooves function as expansion joints in the wall.

In conclusion, achieving high-quality

. Now, let's delve into the process of checking cement quality and its importance.

Understanding cement composition

Cement, commonly found in grey powdery form within sturdy paper bags, is a composition of various materials. Primary components include limestone, sand, iron ore, and bauxite. Additional elements like chalk, clay, and slate can also be part of its composition. These raw materials undergo processing and are subjected to high temperatures around 1500 degrees celsius. The resulting fine grey powder is then packaged and sold in the market.

The significance of cement quality check

Checking cement quality is a pivotal step for builders and masons to ensure the structural integrity of constructions. While these checks might not encompass all cement properties, they offer insights into its strength and overall quality. Fortunately, you don't need to be an expert to conduct these tests. Here are some straightforward field tests that anyone can perform to ascertain cement quality:

1. Manufacturing date check:

Inspect the manufacturing date printed on the cement bag, typically located on the back or side. It's crucial to use cement within 90 days from its manufacturing date. Cement's strength can diminish over time due to moisture absorption. Freshly produced cement has a high affinity for moisture in the air, which accelerates its chemical reaction called ""Hydration."" using older cement can result in reduced binding effectiveness and overall structural strength.

3 months: The

strength of cement

can typically decrease by around 20% to 30% from its initial strength during the first three months of its manufacturing date.

6 months: By the six-month mark, the strength reduction becomes more pronounced, ranging from 30% to 40% of its original strength.

12 months: After a year, the ageing process further affects the cement's strength, leading to a reduction of approximately 40% to 50% from its initial strength.

2. Colour examination:

Quality cement possesses a uniform grey colour with a faint greenish tint. This colour is an indicator of the burning process and composition. Dark greenish shades could suggest an excessive amount of lime or clay, affecting the cement's performance and setting characteristics. A consistent, light grey hue is generally an indication of well-processed and high-quality cement.

3. Lumps inspection:

Upon opening the cement bag, carefully examine its contents for any lumps. The presence of lumps suggests that the cement has come into contact with moisture. A bag with lumps should be rejected, as it might compromise the construction's integrity.

4. Cement float test:

Take a handful of cement and gently release it into a bucket of water. Good-quality cement will initially float on the water's surface before eventually sinking. Impure or low-quality cement, on the other hand, will rapidly sink due to the presence of heavy impurities. This test assesses the density and impurity level of the cement.

5. Adulteration test:

Rub a small amount of cement between your fingers.

Quality cement

should feel smooth and fine to the touch. If you feel grittiness or roughness, it could indicate adulteration with excessive amounts of sand or other impurities. A smooth texture suggests that the cement is well-processed and has a consistent composition.

6. Cement temperature test:

Insert your clean and dry hand into the cement bag, and touch the cement powder. If it feels cool to the touch, it suggests that the cement hasn't undergone hydration due to moisture exposure. However, if the cement feels warm, it indicates that hydration has started, which may lead to reduced strength and performance. Opt for cement that feels cool, indicating its freshness and quality.

7. Cement strength test:

For this test, create a cement block measuring 25mm x 25mm x 200mm and immerse it in water for seven days. After the immersion period, place the block on supports about 15 cm apart and apply a weight of around 34 kg on top of the block. A good-quality cement block should remain intact and show no signs of cracks or failure under this load, indicating its strength and durability.

8. Cement odour test:

While being cautious, smell the cement to detect any unusual odours. Quality cement should be odourless. If you detect an earthy smell, it could be an indication of excess clay and sand in the cement composition. An abnormal odour might imply a compromised mixture, affecting the final construction quality.

9. Cement setting test:

Prepare a thick paste of cement and water, resembling a cake-like structure, and place it on a glass plate. Submerge the glass plate in water for 24 hours. After this period,

examine the cement cake

for cracks or deformities. A well-structured, crack-free cake signifies that the cement has a consistent setting quality and will perform well in construction.

10. Consistency test:

In this test, mix cement with water to form a thick paste. Spread the paste onto a glass plate to create a uniform, flat shape. After 24 hours, observe the consistency and shape of the cement. A uniform and consistent shape indicates that the cement maintains its desired properties during the setting process, ensuring a high-quality construction outcome.

Final word

Checking cement quality on-site during preliminary inspection is essential. While these tests provide a rough idea of cement quality, not all engineering properties can be assessed through them. Remember, the

Find out why they are essential for modern construction",Business,3 minutes,how-additives-in-concrete-improve-workability-and-durability,How additives in concrete improve workability and durability,N/A,N/A,"Concrete additives have revolutionised the construction industry by enhancing both workability and durability. These innovations have been integral to building resilient structures that stand the test of time. From combating environmental challenges to enabling complex designs, concrete additives provide a versatile toolkit for engineers and architects alike. Let’s explore how these additives contribute to iconic structures and improve construction efficiency.

Additives have played a pivotal role in some of India’s most ambitious projects. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai utilised pozzolanic additives to counteract seawater’s corrosive effects, ensuring durability for decades. Similarly, the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi incorporated air-entraining agents to enhance runway resilience against extreme temperatures and monsoons. These examples illustrate how additives address engineering challenges while ensuring sustainability.

What are concrete additives?

Concrete additives are materials mixed into concrete to alter or enhance its properties. They address specific construction challenges, such as improving ease of application or ensuring structures withstand harsh conditions. Additives are broadly classified into two categories:

Workability-enhancing additives:

These improve the handling, mixing, and placement of concrete.

Durability-enhancing additives:

These enhance concrete’s ability to resist wear and environmental stressors.

Reinforced structural components: critical areas of the truck body, such as the chassis, sidewalls, and bed, are reinforced with bracing, gussets, and support beams to enhance strength and durability.

Modular design: the truck body may feature a modular design that allows for easy customisation and integration of specialised equipment, such as hydraulic systems for dumping or loading heavy materials.

Corrosion resistance: given the harsh operating environments typically encountered in construction and mining, the truck body is treated with corrosion-resistant coatings or materials to extend its service life.

Integrated safety features: safety considerations, such as anti-slip surfaces, reflective markings, and securement points for cargo, are integrated into the design to ensure the safety of operators and bystanders.

Case study 2: light-duty trucks for urban delivery and logistics

In urban delivery and logistics applications, trucks must be agile, fuel-efficient, and capable of navigating congested city streets while offering sufficient cargo capacity.

Design features

Lightweight yet durable construction: the truck body uses lightweight steel alloys or composite materials to minimise weight while maintaining structural integrity.

Aerodynamic design: streamlined shapes and features, such as rounded corners and integrated fairings, reduce air resistance and improve fuel efficiency, particularly at highway speeds.

Space optimisation: the interior layout of the truck body is carefully optimised to maximise cargo space while accommodating various types of cargo and storage solutions.

Accessibility and manoeuvrability: features like low floor heights, wide-opening doors, and rear-view cameras enhance accessibility and manoeuvrability in urban environments with tight spaces and obstacles.

To sum up, steel plays a vital role in the structural design of truck bodies. It provides the necessary strength, durability, and versatility to create optimised structures that meet performance requirements while minimising weight. The

strength of steel

is determined by the amount of carbon it contains. The higher the amount, the stronger the metal. If you intend to use your truck for heavy-duty jobs, steel is the best material for you."

The use of steel reinforcements ensures durability, safety, and efficiency in these structures.

Role of steel reinforcements in solar carports

Load-bearing capacity

Solar carports must support dynamic and static loads, including the weight of solar panels, mounting systems, and external forces like wind and snow. Steel reinforcements enhance the structural strength of key components such as columns, beams, and trusses.

Example: High-strength steel grades like ASTM A36 or EN S355 are commonly used for beams, offering a yield strength of 250–355 MPa, capable of supporting heavy loads.

Flexural strength

Beams in solar carports experience bending moments due to the weight of the panels and external forces. Steel reinforcements improve flexural strength, allowing the structure to resist deformation and sagging under these loads.

Stability against environmental loads

Wind loads: Steel reinforcements provide the necessary rigidity to withstand high wind speeds, reducing the risk of structural failure. For instance, wind bracing systems made from steel rods or plates prevent lateral sway.

Snow loads: In regions with heavy snowfall, steel reinforcements in roof structures ensure that carports can bear the additional weight without collapsing.

Corrosion resistance

Solar carports are exposed to the elements, making corrosion resistance a critical factor. Steel reinforcements are often galvanised or coated with protective layers to enhance their resistance to rust, ensuring longevity.

Example: Galvanised steel coated with zinc offers a protective layer that prevents oxidation, even in high-moisture environments.

Anchorage and foundation stability

, Rapid Hardening Cement, and

Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC)

, each offering specific benefits such as durability and resistance to environmental factors. Proper curing techniques are essential for ensuring the full strength and durability of the concrete, as they facilitate hydration, prevent cracks, and promote surface hardness and uniformity. Adequate curing ultimately contributes to the long-term stability and integrity of the foundation.

Concrete floors and slabs

Cement-based floors and slabs are strong, durable, versatile, fire-resistant, and energy-efficient. Concrete mixes can be expected to be high-strength, self-consolidating, lightweight, or fibre-reinforced, depending on the application. Decorative concrete finishes require proper surface preparation, choice of materials, finishing techniques, sealing and protection, and maintenance. Portland cement is the most common type used due to its versatility, providing excellent strength and durability.

Walls and columns

Cement combines aggregates and water to create a robust building material for load-bearing and non-load-bearing walls. Pouring and curing techniques are crucial for strength and durability. Curing techniques like wet curing, curing compounds, and insulated curing blankets facilitate cement hydration and prevent cracking. These blocks are stacked and secured with mortar (cement, sand, and water) to form strong and durable walls.

2gFkW3lupYH6jMCgLLbqGT,The influence of water-cement ratio on workability and strength,The Influence of Water-Cement Ratio on Workability and Strength | JSW One MSME Blog,Learn how to optimise the water-cement ratio for various construction projects to enhance durability and ensure the best performance.,Business,3 minutes,the-influence-of-water-cement-ratio-on-workability-and-strength,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"The Water-Cement ratio (W/C ratio) is the ratio of weight of water to the

weight of cement

used in a concrete mix. This ratio is crucial because it determines the quality of the concrete. The ideal W/C ratio varies depending on the desired strength and durability of the concrete and the specific application.

The W/C ratio typically ranges from 0.40 to 0.60 for most concrete applications. A ratio of 0.40 means that for every 50 kilograms of cement (equivalent to one standard bag of cement), 20 litres of water should be added. Conversely, a ratio of 0.60 would require 30 litres of water for the same amount of cement.

The impact on workability

Workability refers to the ease with which concrete can be mixed, transported, placed, and finished. It is a crucial factor, particularly in projects where the concrete must be placed in complex forms or around dense reinforcement. The workability of concrete increases with the water content, which makes the mix easier to handle. However, there is a trade-off between workability and strength.

When the water content in the mix is high (resulting in a high W/C ratio), the concrete becomes more fluid and easier to work with. While higher water content increase workability, it can compromise strength and uniformity. This can be particularly advantageous in situations where the concrete needs to flow into tight spaces or where manual compaction methods are employed. However, too much water can lead to segregation of the components, causing the sand and aggregate to separate from the cement paste. This segregation can compromise the uniformity of the concrete mix and reduce its overall quality.

To maintain workability without compromising the strength of the concrete, plasticisers or super-plasticisers are often added to the mix. These additives improve the flowability of the concrete without the need for additional water, thus allowing for a lower W/C ratio while still achieving the desired workability preserving the strength.

The influence on strength

The strength of concrete is its ability to withstand loads without failure. It is one of the most important properties of concrete, particularly in structural applications where the material must support significant weights. The W/C ratio has a direct impact on the compressive strength of concrete.

A lower W/C ratio generally leads to higher strength and durability of the concrete. This is because less water reduces the porosity of the hardened concrete. When water is added to

cement

, it reacts chemically to form a hard matrix that binds the aggregates together. However, not all the water used in the mix is consumed in this hydration process. The excess water remains in the concrete and eventually evaporates, leaving behind microscopic pores. These pores weaken the concrete, reducing its strength and durability.

For example, a W/C ratio of 0.35 might produce concrete with very high strength, but the mix could be too stiff to be workable. It may not flow well enough to be placed and compacted, leading to an uneven and potentially weak structure. To counter this, construction professionals may use a W/C ratio of around 0.45 to 0.60, which offers a good balance between workability and strength. In scenarios where higher strength is required, and workability is still a concern, plasticisers are employed to maintain the fluidity of the concrete mix.

The dangers of excess water

While it might seem that more water would simply make concrete easier to work with, too much water can be detrimental to both the workability and strength of the concrete. An overly high W/C ratio results in several problems:

Segregation: as mentioned earlier, too much water can cause the

cement paste

to separate from the aggregates, leading to an uneven mix that is difficult to work with and results in weaker concrete.

Bleeding and shrinkage: excess water that is not used in the hydration process will eventually evaporate from the concrete. This can cause bleeding, where water rises to the surface of the concrete during setting, leading to weak, porous surfaces. Additionally, as the water evaporates, the concrete can shrink, leading to internal cracks and visible fractures, particularly around corners and edges. These imperfections significantly reduce the overall strength and durability of the concrete.

Reduced strength: the formation of microscopic pores due to excess water weakens the concrete, leading to a reduction in its compressive strength. This is especially problematic in structural elements designed to bear loads, as weakened concrete may fail to perform as expected, compromising the safety and longevity of the structure.

Testing and optimising the water-cement ratio

To ensure that the W/C ratio is optimised for both strength and workability, several tests can be conducted. One common method is the slump test, which measures the consistency of fresh concrete before it sets. In this test, concrete is placed in a conical mould, which is then lifted off, allowing the concrete to slump. The amount by which the concrete slumps indicates its workability. For instance:

Mass concrete and road work: 2.5 to 5 cm slump

Ordinary beams and slabs: 5 to 10 cm slump

Columns and thin vertical sections: 7.5 to 12.5 cm slump

These values help determine the appropriate W/C ratio for different types of construction work. By adjusting the water content and using plasticisers as needed, the concrete mix can be optimised for a project's specific requirements.

Conclusion

The water-cement ratio is a critical factor in concrete mix design, directly affecting the workability and strength of the concrete. A balanced approach is required to ensure that the concrete is workable enough to be placed and compacted properly while maintaining the strength necessary for the structure's durability. By carefully managing the W/C ratio and plasticisers when needed, construction professionals can optimise concrete performance for specific project requirements."

are a foundational element in construction, providing the necessary strength and flexibility to create robust structures. For Indian MSMEs involved in construction projects, ensuring that the TMT bars they procure meet these criteria can significantly influence their builds' quality, safety, and cost-efficiency.

What is uniform gauge and dimensional accuracy?

Uniform gauge and dimensional accuracy in TMT bars refer to the consistency of their diameter, cross-sectional area, and weight along their entire length. Variations in these parameters can result in uneven load distribution, reduced structural integrity, and potential compliance issues with building codes.

Gauge uniformity: this ensures that the bar’s diameter remains consistent along its length, which is crucial for even stress distribution in reinforced concrete structures.

Dimensional accuracy: this ensures that the bar’s size and weight align precisely with its stated specifications (e.g., 8mm, 10mm, or 16mm), ensuring compatibility with engineering designs and safety standards.

Why are uniform gauges and dimensions critical in TMT bars?

Dimensional accuracy and uniform gauge directly affect the performance and reliability of reinforced concrete structures. Some of the critical implications include:

Load distribution:

Reinforced concrete relies on the synergy between steel and concrete. Any inconsistency in the TMT bar’s gauge can cause uneven stress distribution, potentially leading to cracks or failure under load.

Structural safety:

TMT bars that deviate from specified dimensions can compromise the safety of the structure. For example, bars that are thinner than stated may not provide the required tensile strength, while thicker bars could result in improper bonding with concrete.

Adherence to design specifications:

Engineers design structures based on precise calculations. Deviations in bar dimensions can lead to non-compliance with these designs, resulting in weaker sections or overspending on additional reinforcements.

Seismic performance:

Structural flexibility and energy absorption are critical in earthquake-prone zones. Uniformly gauged TMT bars ensure the structure behaves predictably under seismic loads, reducing the risk of catastrophic failure.

Factors affecting uniform gauge and dimension in TMT bars

Several factors influence TMT bars' gauge and dimensional accuracy, including: Manufacturing precision: High-quality rolling mills equipped with advanced technology ensure consistent diameter and weight across the bar's length. Automated processes minimise human error, thus ensuring uniformity in core diameter throughout the bars.  Raw material quality:

The consistency of the steel billet used in the production of TMT bars plays a significant role in maintaining dimensional accuracy. Impurities or inconsistent material properties can lead to irregularities during rolling.  Process control: The rolling process, followed by quenching and self-tempering, must be closely monitored to avoid deviations. Modern mills use computerised control systems to achieve precise tolerances. Quality testing: Reputable manufacturers conduct rigorous testing to ensure dimensional uniformity. Parameters such as diameter variation, weight per metre, and cross-sectional consistency are checked to meet

IS 1786:2008

standards.

Impact of uniform gauge and dimension on construction quality

Enhanced bonding with concrete:

Uniformly gauged TMT bars ensure consistent rib patterns, which improve their grip on concrete. This bonding is critical for effectively transferring loads between the steel and concrete, enhancing overall structural strength.

Optimised material utilisation:

Accurate dimensions ensure that the calculated quantities of steel are sufficient for the project. Overweight bars lead to unnecessary costs, while underweight bars may compromise safety.

Improved seismic resilience:

Uniform TMT bars

distribute stress evenly during seismic events, enabling the structure to absorb and dissipate energy more effectively.

Ease of construction:

Variations in gauge can create challenges during construction, such as difficulties in bending, tying, or placing the bars. Uniform dimensions ensure smoother operations and reduce labour costs.

Compliance with standards:

Uniformly gauged TMT bars ensure adherence to IS standards and project specifications, minimising the risk of penalties or delays due to non-compliance.

Key considerations for MSMEs when procuring TMT bars

For MSMEs,

procuring TMT bars

with consistent gauge and dimensions is essential for achieving cost-efficient and high-quality construction. Here are a few considerations:

Source from trusted suppliers:

Choose suppliers or platforms like

JSW One MSME

, which ensure that all TMT bars meet stringent quality standards, including dimensional accuracy.

are critical components in modern construction, combining high tensile strength and superior ductility to meet the rigorous demands of infrastructure and industrial projects. For Indian MSMEs engaged in construction and manufacturing, understanding the technical metrics that define

TMT bar quality

is essential to ensure structural reliability and compliance with safety standards. Among these metrics, the UTS/YS ratio—ultimate tensile strength to yield strength ratio—is a vital performance indicator.

What is the UTS/YS ratio?

The UTS/YS ratio measures a material's ability to resist deformation under load and its capacity to sustain stress before failure. It is calculated as the ratio of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) to yield strength (YS):

Yield strength (YS): the stress at which a TMT bar exhibits permanent plastic deformation. Beyond this point, the material will not return to its original shape when the stress is removed.

Ultimate tensile strength (UTS): the maximum stress a TMT bar can endure before losing strength and finally fracturing.

This ratio indicates how much additional load the material can bear after yielding and before ultimate failure. This also indicates the ability of TMT bars to absorb energy in case of any unanticipated high load. It is critical for determining the ability of TMT bars to perform under dynamic loads and adverse conditions.

Why is the UTS/YS ratio critical?

The UTS/YS ratio represents the balance between ductility and strength, both essential for structural integrity. A higher UTS/YS ratio indicates better energy absorption capabilities, making it crucial in applications where structures are subjected to dynamic stresses, such as seismic activity or high-impact loads.

Key technical implications of UTS/YS ratio include:

Seismic resistance: structures in seismic zones benefit from TMT bars with high UTS/YS ratios, as these bars can deform plastically without sudden failure, absorbing and dissipating energy during an earthquake.

Progressive failure mode: a higher UTS/YS ratio promotes ductile failure over brittle failure. Ductile failure provides a gradual and visible warning, while brittle failure occurs catastrophically and without notice.

Performance under fluctuating loads: industrial facilities, bridges, and high-rise buildings experience variable and cyclic loads. TMT bars with optimal UTS/YS ratios ensure safety and stability in these environments.

Ideal UTS/YS ratio for TMT bars

Standards such as

IS 1786:2008

recommend a UTS/YS ratio between 1.08 and 1.25 for high-quality TMT bars. This range ensures a sufficient safety margin between the stress at which the bar deforms plastically and the stress at which it fractures. Bars within this range balance strength and ductility, making them suitable for resilient and reliable applications.

Factors affecting UTS/YS ratio in TMT bars

The UTS/YS ratio in TMT bars depends on several technical factors:

Manufacturing process:

The thermo-mechanical treatment (TMT) process—comprising quenching, self-tempering, and annealing—directly influences the bar's microstructure. Proper process parameter control ensures a tempered martensitic outer layer and a softer ferrite-pearlite core, optimising the UTS/YS ratio.

Chemical composition:

Low-carbon steel with controlled levels of alloying elements such as manganese, vanadium, or niobium enhances the bar’s mechanical properties. Excess impurities like sulphur and phosphorus adversely affect ductility and can reduce the UTS/YS ratio.

Bar geometry:

Smaller-diameter bars exhibit slightly higher UTS/YS ratios due to higher deformation during rolling and faster heat transfer during quenching. This aspect must be factored into material selection for specific applications.

Heat treatment consistency:

Variability in quenching or tempering can lead to non-uniform properties along the length of the bar, negatively impacting the UTS/YS ratio. Applications of TMT bars with optimised UTS/YS ratio

TMT bars with a favourable UTS/YS ratio are ideal for:

Critical load-bearing components: high-rise buildings, bridges, and flyovers.

Seismic structures: buildings in earthquake-prone zones require bars with high energy absorption capacity.

Industrial facilities: applications involving cyclic or dynamic loading, such as manufacturing plants.

The role of the UTS/YS ratio in MSME procurement decisions

For MSMEs sourcing TMT bars, evaluating the UTS/YS ratio is not just a technical requirement but a strategic necessity. Selecting TMT bars with the appropriate ratio directly impacts construction projects' quality, safety, and longevity. Additionally, compliance with standards ensures alignment with regulatory requirements and minimises liability risks.

Discover tips on inventory management, flexible payment terms, forecasting, and more to ensure financial stability and business continuity.",Business,3 minutes,off-balance-sheet-financing-how-businesses-can-access-funds-without-adding,Read now,N/A,N/A,"Off-balance sheet financing (OBSF) might sound technical, but it’s simply a way for businesses to get the funding they need without piling up debt on their books. It’s a handy option for businesses that want to grow, improve cash flow, or fund operations while keeping their financial statements strong. Here’s an overview of it, how it works, and examples of how it can help businesses like yours.

What is off-balance sheet financing?

OBSF is a way to raise funds without showing them as debt or liability on your balance sheet. Instead of traditional loans that increase your company’s debt, OBSF uses methods like leasing or partnerships, where financial obligations are recorded differently.

This approach helps keep your debt-to-equity ratio low,

making your business more attractive

to investors or lenders. It also ensures you can get the funds you need without crossing borrowing limits or straining your cash flow.

How does it work?

Common types of off-balance sheet financing

Leasing instead of buying

Leasing allows you to use assets like equipment or property without owning them. Payments for the lease are treated as operating expenses rather than debt.

Example: instead of buying expensive construction equipment, a contractor leases it. This keeps the costs manageable and off the balance sheet.

Factoring invoices

Factoring lets you sell unpaid invoices to a third party in exchange for immediate cash. You get the funds you need without taking on a loan, and the liability for collecting the payments shifts to the factoring company.

JSW One’s Invoice Factoring Program

provides unsecured credit up to 90 days, allowing businesses to access funds efficiently while maintaining healthy balance sheets.

Example: an MSME sells its pending invoices to a factoring firm to get upfront cash for paying workers or buying materials.

Setting up a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)

An SPV is a separate entity created to handle a specific project. It raises its own funds, and any debt it takes on stays off your balance sheet.

Example: a property developer forms an SPV to finance a new housing project, keeping the risks and debt separate from their main business.

Partnering with others

Joint ventures or partnerships spread the costs and responsibilities between companies, so the debt doesn’t fall entirely on your business.

Example: a steel manufacturer partners with another company to set up a shared production unit, with the joint venture bearing the financial burden.

Selling and leasing back assets

This approach involves selling an asset, like property or machinery, and leasing it back. It gives you cash to work with while allowing you to use the assets for operations. Example: a factory sells its warehouse to an investor, gets the money upfront, and continues to use the warehouse by leasing it back.

Why consider off-balance sheet financing?

Keep your financials healthy: OBSF keeps liabilities off your balance sheet, making your financial ratios, such as debt-to-equity, more attractive to investors and lenders.

Access more funds: by keeping debt levels low, you maintain the flexibility to borrow when needed.

Improve cash flow: arrangements like leasing or factoring provide immediate cash without requiring large upfront investments.

Reduce risk: methods like SPVs and joint ventures help isolate risks associated with specific projects.

JSW One

offers trade credit options like Letter of Credit (LC) and Bank Guarantee (BG) that provide up to 90 days of credit for purchases. These solutions help businesses maintain operational liquidity without impacting their balance sheets.

What should you watch out for?

OBSF presents challenges such as compliance risks, dependence on third parties, and hidden costs. To overcome these problems, businesses should:

Ensure transparent reporting to build stakeholder trust.

Comply with accounting standards and regulations to avoid penalties.

Diversify financing methods to reduce reliance on any single source.

Carefully evaluate total costs, including hidden fees, to ensure value.

Use digital tools for tracking and monitoring OBSF arrangements.

By addressing these challenges strategically,

MSMEs can leverage OBSF

effectively to access funds while maintaining financial health."

Inventory costs can weigh down cash flow, especially when demand is low. Reducing inventory to levels aligned with off-peak demand helps free up capital.

2. Negotiate flexible payment terms with suppliers

Cash flow often relies on supplier payment terms. During off-peak seasons, negotiating flexible or extended terms can give businesses more time to pay without putting pressure on cash reserves. Many platforms offer

credit solutions tailored for MSMEs

, such as trade credit against BG/LC provided by JSW One, which allows deferred payments and eases cash flow pressures.

3. Implement customer payment incentives

Cash flow issues can sometimes arise from customers' delayed payments. Consider offering small discounts or incentives for early payments to encourage faster payments. Automating invoicing can ensure timely reminders, making it easier to manage receivables.

4. Explore credit appropriately solutions for MSMEs

Credit lines can offer short-term liquidity, which is especially useful for covering operational expenses without compromising essential resources or halting business activities. Additionally,

MSME-specific financing products

often feature more favourable terms, such as lower interest rates and simplified application processes.

5. Reduce variable expenses

During the off-peak season, identify non-essential expenses that can be temporarily reduced or postponed. Limiting overtime hours, postponing certain non-essential purchases, or negotiating reduced rates for utilities can lower overhead. 

Implementing energy-efficient practices or re-evaluating suppliers for basic services may also contribute to cost savings during these lean months.

6. Implement a cash flow forecasting system

A reliable cash flow forecasting system can help anticipate shortfalls and plan. Forecasting allows business owners to project cash inflows and outflows, preparing them to take corrective actions if cash reserves appear insufficient. 

Digital platforms, including those offered by B2B marketplaces like JSW One MSME, often feature integrated financial planning tools. These tools enable accurate forecasting and better resource management during off-peak seasons.

7. Consider offering new services or diversifying

Diversifying product offerings or introducing value-added services may help generate steady revenue even during slower periods. For example, if the demand for construction materials slows, some MSMEs find success in offering maintenance services or consultancy.

8. Maintain a cash reserve

Setting aside cash reserves from peak season profits can be a financial cushion during off-peak periods. This reserve can cover unexpected expenses and help manage routine costs without resorting to emergency loans. 

Regularly revisiting and adjusting the reserve fund in alignment with business growth and needs ensures that it remains sufficient to cover anticipated lean periods.

9. Utilise technology for expense tracking

Advanced digital solutions, such as expense-tracking tools,

enable MSMEs

to monitor where their money is going closely. Detailed tracking improves expense management and highlights areas where costs could be cut or postponed."

solar energy sector

is undergoing transformative innovations, including flexible solar panels, solar paint, and space-based solutions, which are propelling the world toward cleaner energy solutions. India has emerged as a key player in this global transition, ranking 4th in solar capacity worldwide, with its solar power capacity surging from 21,651 MW in 2018 to 70,096 MW in 2023. By 2030, the country aims to achieve 500 GW of renewable energy capacity and generate 50% of its energy needs from renewables. Initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, Solar Park Scheme, and PM-KUSUM are fostering domestic manufacturing, job creation, and decentralized energy production. Cutting-edge developments, such as tandem cells and organic semiconductors, are advancing solar efficiency and sustainability.

Why steel is the backbone of solar panel structures

Among the

types of steel

used in solar structures,

galvanised steel

is the most common due to its ability to resist corrosion. Its zinc coating provides a protective barrier, ensuring the structure remains strong and rust-free, even in coastal or high-humidity areas. For projects that require extra durability, high-strength steel is another popular choice. It offers enhanced load-bearing capacity while being lightweight, making it easier to transport and install.

Galvanised steel (GI): coated with zinc, it protects against corrosion, with coatings ranging from 80GSM to 550GSM. It is widely used in rooftop installations and ground-mount projects, depending on environmental conditions and desired durability.

Galvalume steel (GL): a mix of aluminium, zinc, and silicon, offers enhanced corrosion resistance, especially in humid or coastal regions. It reflects sunlight, reduces heat absorption, and is lighter, providing cost benefits in large-scale projects.

Factors that define steel quality for solar applications

Corrosion resistance

Rust weakens the steel’s structural integrity, leading to potential safety hazards and reduced durability. To address this, treatments like galvanisation are crucial. Galvanised steel is coated with a layer of zinc, which acts as a protective barrier, preventing rust and extending the structure's lifespan. In more demanding environments, such as coastal regions with high salinity, powder coating is often applied as an additional layer of protection. This ensures the steel maintains its strength and appearance even under severe conditions, reducing maintenance costs and improving long-term reliability.

Strength and load-bearing capacity

High-quality steel

ensures the structure can bear the weight of solar panels, maintain alignment, and remain stable during strong winds or other environmental stresses. Substandard steel, with lower tensile strength or inconsistent material properties, can compromise the structural safety of solar installations, leading to deformation, misalignment, or even collapse. High-strength steel alloys are often used to achieve the necessary load-bearing capacity while keeping the material lightweight, which is advantageous for transportation and installation.

Fabrication quality

Precision cutting ensures all components fit accurately, avoiding stress points that can weaken the structure. Welding quality is equally critical; poor welds can create weak joints prone to failure under load or environmental stress. Automated fabrication techniques, like laser cutting and robotic welding, offer greater precision and consistency, improving the alignment and stability of the solar panel structure.

India’s 2047 vision focuses on achieving 90% renewable energy and energy independence through green technologies, creating millions of jobs and attracting global investments estimated at $350-400 billion annually. This ambitious path not only combats climate change and reduces pollution but also offers lucrative opportunities for investors to contribute to and benefit from India’s growing clean energy sector."

Learn about the critical properties of cement, best practices for its use, and insights for MSMEs in delivering safer and durable construction solutions.",Product,3 minutes,designing-earthquake-resistant-infrastructure-the-critical-role-of-cement,Read now,N/A,N/A,"Earthquakes pose significant challenges to infrastructure, especially in seismically active regions. Designing buildings and other structures to withstand seismic forces is essential for minimising damage and ensuring safety. Cement, a key component in concrete, plays a vital role in creating earthquake-resistant infrastructure due to its versatility, strength, and ability to form durable composites with reinforcement. This blog delves into the

critical role cement

plays in earthquake-resistant construction and offers technical insights for Indian MSMEs in the construction sector.

The mechanics of earthquake forces

Understanding how earthquakes affect structures is fundamental to designing resilient infrastructure. Earthquakes generate lateral and vertical ground movements, exerting dynamic forces on buildings. These forces can cause soft story mechanism and brittle failures, particularly when a structure lacks flexibility and strength. The primary challenge is to create a structure that can absorb and dissipate these seismic energies without significant failure.

The role of cement in seismic design

Cement forms the backbone of reinforced concrete, one of the most commonly used materials for earthquake-resistant construction. Reinforced concrete combines the

compressive strength of cement

with the tensile strength of steel, creating a composite material that can better withstand dynamic forces. The properties of the cement used in the concrete mix can influence the behavior of the structure during seismic events.

1. High compressive strength

Cement provides the compressive strength necessary for a building to support vertical loads, even under the stress of an earthquake. Structures designed with high-strength cement mixes can resist cracking and buckling, which are common failure modes during seismic activity. Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) grades such as

OPC 43

and

OPC 53

are commonly used for structural applications due to their high compressive strength. For projects requiring additional durability and rapid load-bearing capacity, higher-grade cement or blended cements with pozzolanic materials may be considered.

2. Ductility enhancement

While cement itself is rigid and has high compressive strength, reinforced concrete made with a well-designed mix can provide ductility, which is the ability of a structure to undergo significant deformation without sudden failure. This is a critical property for earthquake-resistant construction, as ductile materials can absorb energy and prevent catastrophic collapse.

Admixtures can be added to the cement mix to improve the ductility and overall performance of the concrete. These admixtures include plasticisers and superplasticisers, which enhance workability and reduce the water-cement ratio, thereby increasing the concrete's strength and flexibility.

Best practices for using cement in earthquake-resistant structures

1. Quality control in cement selection

The selection of high-quality cement is paramount for ensuring the integrity of earthquake-resistant infrastructure. Cement must meet the relevant Indian Standards (IS codes) for construction to ensure it performs well under stress. For earthquake-resistant structures, the use of OPC with high early strength or

Portland pozzolana cement (PPC)

/

Portland slag cement (PSC)

is recommended, as PPC offers enhanced durability and crack resistance due to its pozzolanic reaction, which reduces micro-cracking and enhances long-term strength.

2. Proper mix design

The mix design of concrete significantly impacts its behavior during an earthquake. The ideal mix should have a balance between strength and workability, with a water-cement ratio that ensures the concrete is both strong and easy to place. A mix with too much water will result in weaker concrete with increased porosity, reducing its ability to withstand seismic forces.

The use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) such as fly ash or silica fume or GGBS can improve the performance of the concrete mix. Fly ash helps in reducing permeability and enhances the long-term strength of the concrete, making it more resistant to cracking under stress.

3. Reinforcement considerations

Cement works in conjunction with steel reinforcement to create reinforced concrete. The spacing, placement, and anchoring of reinforcement bars are crucial to achieving an earthquake-resistant design. The cement used must bond well with the steel reinforcement to ensure that the composite material acts as a single unit during seismic activity.

Application of cement in key structural elements

1. Shear walls

Shear walls are vertical elements that provide lateral resistance and improve the stability of a structure during an earthquake. These walls are often constructed using reinforced concrete, and the type of cement used can significantly impact their strength and performance. High-strength cement with low permeability is ideal for constructing shear walls, as it enhances their ability to withstand seismic shear forces.

2. Foundation systems

Cement is used in creating reinforced concrete footings and mat foundations that distribute loads evenly and minimise differential settlement. The concrete mix for foundations should be designed to have high compressive strength and low permeability to prevent moisture ingress, which can weaken the structure over time.

For areas with challenging soil conditions, deep foundations such as piles may be used. Cement plays a vital role in the construction of reinforced concrete piles, which must be designed to resist not only vertical loads but also lateral seismic forces. The use of high-quality cement in pile construction ensures that the foundations remain stable and functional during and after an earthquake.

3. Beam-column joints

The junctions between beams and columns are highly susceptible to failure during seismic activity. Reinforcing these joints with high-quality concrete that includes 10mm and 20mm cubicle shape well-graded aggregates (oversize to be avoided) and admixtures enhances the load transfer and ductility of the structure. Cement with high early strength ensures that these critical points gain sufficient strength quickly, allowing the structure to support seismic loads effectively.

Admixtures and additives for enhanced seismic performance

Admixtures play a key role in modifying the properties of cement and concrete to better suit the requirements of earthquake-resistant construction. Superplasticisers reduce the water content while maintaining workability, leading to stronger concrete. Air-entraining agents introduce microscopic air bubbles that improve the concrete's resistance to freeze-thaw cycles, which can be beneficial for structures in regions that experience both earthquakes and varying weather conditions.

Other additives, such as fibers (steel or synthetic), can be included in the cement mix to improve tensile strength and crack resistance. Fiber-reinforced concrete can absorb and distribute stress more evenly, reducing the risk of sudden cracking during seismic events.

The benefits of high-quality cement for MSMEs

For Indian MSMEs engaged in construction, understanding the role of cement in earthquake-resistant infrastructure is essential for delivering projects that meet safety standards and customer expectations. Using

high-quality cement

not only improves the safety and durability of structures but also enhances the reputation of the business. Reliable projects lead to better client satisfaction, repeat business, and competitive advantages in the marketplace."

Learn about zinc-based, and polymer for long-lasting performance.",Product,3 minutes,corrosion-resistant-steel-coatings-for-auto-parts-in-harsh-indian-climates,Read now,N/A,N/A,"The harsh and varied climate conditions across India, from the saline air of coastal regions to the high humidity of monsoon seasons and the scorching heat of arid zones, pose significant challenges to the durability of automotive parts. Using corrosion-resistant coatings on steel auto parts is critical to ensure long-term performance and safety. Below, we examine the types of coatings available, their properties, and their effectiveness in protecting automotive components from corrosion in India's diverse environments. 

1. Zinc-based galvanic coatings 

Hot-dip galvanising (HDG): one of the most widely used methods for protecting steel, HDG involves immersing

steel parts

in molten zinc. The zinc coating provides sacrificial protection, meaning it corrodes in place of the steel, extending the lifespan of automotive components. This is particularly effective in areas with high humidity or near the sea, where saline exposure accelerates corrosion. The zinc layer also acts as a barrier against moisture and air, preventing oxidation.

Electro-galvanising: in this process, a thinner zinc layer is applied using an electrochemical process. Although not as robust as HDG, electro-galvanising provides a smoother finish, which is ideal for auto parts requiring additional aesthetic coatings. It offers decent protection in less aggressive climates and is often used for interior car parts. 

2. Zinc-aluminium alloy coatings

Zinc-aluminium (Zn-Al) coatings

, such as Galvalume, are increasingly popular due to their superior resistance to atmospheric corrosion. These coatings combine the sacrificial protection of zinc with the longer-lasting, barrier-type protection of aluminium. The resulting layer offers enhanced resistance against corrosion in extreme temperatures, such as those found in India's arid and semi-arid regions, where heat can accelerate the degradation of protective coatings. 

Zn-Al-Mg coatings: adding magnesium to zinc-aluminium coatings improves their protective performance by reducing micro-cracks formation and enhancing their self-healing properties when minor damage occurs. This type of coating is particularly effective for auto parts exposed to fluctuating temperatures and abrasion.

3. Polymer-based coatings 

Epoxy coatings: these coatings provide a hard, durable barrier that resists water and chemical exposure. They are widely used for auto parts that come into contact with road salt, oils, and other corrosive substances. Epoxy coatings can be applied over zinc-based coatings to form a dual-layer system that significantly enhances corrosion resistance, especially in coastal and highly polluted urban environments. 

Polyurethane (PU) coatings: polyurethane coatings are flexible and offer excellent resistance to UV radiation and weathering. PU coatings maintain their performance under extreme sun exposure, such as in the Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Their flexibility also makes them suitable for components subject to vibrations and minor deformations, like chassis parts and undercarriage components. 

4. Phosphate conversion coatings 

Phosphate coatings, particularly zinc-phosphate, create a crystalline layer that improves the adhesion of subsequent paint or powder coatings and provides preliminary corrosion resistance. They are often used as a pre-treatment layer before applying more robust coatings. This is particularly valuable for auto parts prone to moisture exposure during the rainy season, such as suspension components and underbody panels.

5. Ceramic coatings 

Ceramic-based coatings have gained traction for their high-temperature resistance and durability. These coatings offer a unique combination of corrosion resistance and thermal insulation, making them ideal for exhaust components and parts exposed to high heat, like engine manifolds. In regions of India with extreme heat, ceramic coatings help prevent oxidation, which can weaken the structural integrity of steel components. 

6. Anodic and cathodic electrocoating (e-coating) 

Electrocoating (e-coating) is a process that uses electrical current to deposit a uniform, thin coating onto the surface of auto parts. Anodic e-coating is known for its adherence and surface protection, while cathodic e-coating offers superior corrosion resistance. E-coating is frequently used for components requiring detailed coverage and uniform protection, such as car frames and small metal parts. 

This type of coating is highly effective for parts exposed to diverse climates. It can withstand heavy monsoons or high pollution levels, where moisture and corrosive agents are prevalent. 

7. Advanced nanocoatings 

Nanocoatings represent a cutting-edge approach to corrosion protection by providing ultra-thin layers with exceptional hydrophobic properties. These coatings use nanoparticles to create a protective film that repels water, oil, and other contaminants. The technology is particularly promising for enhancing the corrosion resistance of steel auto parts exposed to India's monsoon seasons, as it minimises the formation of water droplets on surfaces, reducing the risk of rust.

8. Multi-layer coating systems 

A comprehensive approach to corrosion protection involves using multi-layer coating systems that combine several types of coatings. For instance, a

steel auto part

could be galvanised, coated with a phosphate conversion layer, and then finished with an epoxy or PU topcoat. This multi-layer protection strategy maximises

corrosion resistance

and extends parts' service life under severe climatic conditions.

Conclusion: Optimising corrosion protection for Indian climates

The choice of

corrosion-resistant steel coatings

for auto parts depends on the specific environmental challenges they face. Zinc-based coatings provide foundational protection, while polymer-based and ceramic coatings offer enhanced resistance against UV and chemical exposure. Advanced techniques such as e-coating and nanocoatings further expand the options for maximising durability."

Learn how to choose the right approach for your project needs.",Business,3 mintes,pre-engineered-steel-building-systems-vs-conventional-buildings,Read now,N/A,N/A,"Pre-Engineered Building (PEB)

systems and conventional buildings represent two distinct approaches to construction, each with its own advantages and limitations. With the rapid growth in India's infrastructure development, understanding these differences can help builders, engineers, and project managers make informed decisions that align with project requirements. Below, we explore the technical and practical differences between PEB systems and conventional buildings. 

1. Design and engineering flexibility 

PEB systems: these structures are designed and fabricated using pre-determined dimensions and specifications, optimised through specialised software. The components are engineered to work together cohesively, ensuring efficient load distribution and reducing the need for excess material. This approach allows for design adaptability within a modular framework, providing options for customisation while maintaining cost and time efficiency.

Conventional buildings: in traditional construction, every building is designed from scratch according to specific project requirements. This results in greater design flexibility but often requires more detailed engineering calculations and a longer design process. Customised architectural features and complex layouts can be incorporated more easily, often leading to increased costs and extended project timelines. 

2. Construction time 

PEB systems: one of the standout advantages of PEBs is their rapid assembly. Components are prefabricated in a factory and transported to the construction site for quick installation. This minimises on-site labour and significantly reduces construction timelines—often by 30-50% compared to conventional methods. The streamlined process means fewer delays due to weather or labour shortages, making PEBs ideal for projects with tight schedules. 

Conventional buildings: these structures require on-site fabrication, including formwork, reinforcement, and concrete pouring. Construction often involves multiple trades and can be heavily affected by on-site conditions, leading to longer timelines. The process typically requires detailed coordination between different teams, which can contribute to potential delays.

3. Material efficiency and structural weight 

PEB systems: these systems use optimised steel sections, such as hot-rolled and cold-formed components, tailored for specific structural needs. Grades like

IS 2062 E250

and

E350

are often employed to achieve the required strength-to-weight ratio. The precise engineering of PEBs means less material is wasted, resulting in lighter structures that maintain high load-bearing capacities. This efficiency reduces the overall weight of the building, which in turn can lower foundation costs. 

Conventional buildings: these often use heavier sections, such as reinforced concrete and conventional steel frames. While robust, these structures generally involve excess material due to less precise engineering, leading to higher overall building weight. The use of concrete, for example, adds significant mass, necessitating deeper and more reinforced foundations, which can increase costs. 

4. Cost considerations 

PEB systems: they typically offer a lower overall cost due to standardisation and efficient use of materials. Prefabrication helps maintain budget predictability by reducing waste and labour costs. The

quicker construction

timeline also contributes to cost savings, requiring fewer on-site resources. 

Conventional buildings: they may initially appear less expensive due to more readily available materials like concrete and standard steel sections. However, the extended project duration and increased on-site labour can lead to higher overall costs. Additionally, custom designs often require more engineering and material, increasing expenses further. 

5. Quality control and construction accuracy 

PEB systems: components are manufactured in a controlled environment with stringent quality checks, ensuring high precision and adherence to design specifications. Factory production minimises defects and discrepancies that can arise during manual on-site fabrication. The assembly process is also straightforward, requiring fewer adjustments. 

Conventional buildings: quality control is more variable as construction takes place on-site. Human error, inconsistent material supply, and environmental conditions can affect the final build quality. While site supervisors and engineers can monitor the process, achieving uniform quality can be more challenging than factory-controlled fabrication. 

6. Structural durability and maintenance 

PEB systems: modern steel grades used in PEBs, such as

IS 2062 E350

, provide excellent resistance to environmental factors, making these buildings durable over long periods. The structures are designed with built-in tolerances for expansion and contraction, accommodating climate variations across India. Maintenance is typically lower, as steel structures resist cracking and termite damage. 

Conventional buildings: while reinforced concrete can provide substantial durability and fire resistance, it may be prone to issues like cracking, spalling, and corrosion of the steel reinforcement, especially in high-humidity environments. Maintenance needs for concrete buildings can be higher over time, particularly for older structures or those exposed to aggressive conditions. 

7. Sustainability and recyclability 

PEB systems: steel is inherently recyclable, contributing to the sustainability of PEBs. Recyclable steel components align with modern green building standards and support eco-friendly construction practices. Additionally, the precision of prefabrication minimises waste, further enhancing sustainability. 

Conventional buildings: while concrete can be partially recycled, the process is more complex and energy-intensive than steel recycling. Additionally, conventional construction often results in more material waste during the build phase, which can contribute to a higher environmental footprint.

Conclusion: choosing between PEB and conventional construction

Both PEB systems and conventional buildings have their place in construction, but the choice depends on project-specific requirements. PEBs excel in projects needing rapid completion, cost control, and material efficiency, making them ideal for industrial, commercial, and warehouse applications. Conventional buildings are more suitable for custom architectural designs and projects that prioritise material and load-bearing flexibility."

are essential in modern construction, particularly in large-scale industrial and commercial applications. Hot-rolled steel serves as a core structural material due to its superior properties. Below, we detail the technical benefits of using hot-rolled steel, focusing on its mechanical properties, common grades, and structural applications in PEB projects. 

1. High structural strength and durability 

The hot-rolling process involves heating steel above its recrystallisation temperature (around 1,100 degrees Celsius) and rolling it into the desired shape. This process refines the grain structure, increasing toughness and uniformity in mechanical properties. Hot-rolled steel grades such as

IS 2062 E250

, and

E350

are extensively used in PEBs.

IS 2062 E250

: Offers a minimum yield strength of 250 MPa, which is suitable for general structural applications.

IS 2062 E350

: Provides a higher yield strength of

350 MPa

, making it ideal for load-bearing structures where enhanced strength is necessary. 

These grades ensure the steel frames can withstand significant axial and lateral loads, maintaining structural integrity under diverse operational conditions.

2. Cost-effectiveness 

The manufacturing of

hot-rolled steel

is less precise than cold-rolled steel, resulting in lower production costs. The simple production process, which involves rolling at high temperatures, reduces the need for secondary processing. IS 2062 E250 provides an optimal balance between price and structural capacity, meeting the budget constraints of large-scale PEB projects without compromising safety or performance. Its cost-effective nature is advantageous for high-volume applications such as industrial warehouses, production facilities, and distribution centres. 

3. Quick and efficient construction 

The malleability of hot-rolled steel facilitates its transformation into various cross-sectional shapes, such as I-beams, H-beams, and wide flange sections, which are critical in PEB construction. The commonly used IS 808 sections, manufactured from IS 2062 E350, support rapid assembly due to their consistency and standardised dimensions. 

Hot-rolled beams and columns can be pre-fabricated, shipped, and installed on-site with minimal adjustments, speeding up the overall construction timeline. The properties of IS 2062 E350 allow for easy welding and bolting, which is crucial for connections and joints that form the backbone of PEB structures. 

4. Versatility in design and load distribution 

Hot-rolled steel’s adaptability allows it to be used in various load-bearing applications. With its isotropic properties, hot-rolled steel ensures even load distribution, preventing structural imbalances. IS 2062 E410 is particularly useful for structures requiring higher tensile strength, such as large-span roofs and high-bay warehouses, without compromising flexibility. 

Steel sections like HSS (Hollow Structural Sections) and wide flange beams derived from E350 grade are used for long-span beams that support significant loads. This reduces the need for interior columns and maximises usable space, allowing for design innovation while meeting the stringent requirements of large industrial and commercial structures.

5. High tolerance to environmental stress and fatigue 

The metallurgical properties of hot-rolled steel, particularly E350 and E410 grades, make it suitable for environments subject to temperature fluctuations and dynamic loading. The thermal expansion properties of these grades help maintain dimensional stability under high temperatures, which is critical for projects exposed to harsh climatic conditions such as those in arid or coastal regions of India. 

Hot-rolled steel exhibits high fatigue resistance, which is beneficial in PEBs where cyclical loading is common, such as in manufacturing plants or logistics hubs. IS 2062 E410 is known for its high tensile strength and ability to perform under stress, making it a reliable choice for demanding applications. 

6. Consistent quality and availability

Steel grades like IS 2062

are standardised and produced in large volumes by Indian steel manufacturers, ensuring consistent mechanical properties and chemical composition. This standardisation facilitates quality control and compliance with building codes and standards, such as the Indian Standard Code IS 800, which governs the general construction of steel structures. 

The ready availability of these grades allows for the seamless scaling of large

PEB projects

without the risk of supply chain disruptions. IS 2062 E250 and E350 grades are widely produced, supporting the needs of various structural components from primary load-bearing members to secondary bracing systems."

Driven piles: driven piles are steel or concrete posts driven into the ground using specialised equipment such as pile drivers or hydraulic hammers. This method suits dense or rocky soils where drilling may be challenging.

Auger anchors: auger anchors are screw-like devices that are screwed into the ground using machinery or manual labour. They are commonly used in softer soils and provide good holding capacity.

Ballasted systems: in some cases, steel support structures may be anchored using ballast, such as concrete blocks or weighted frames. This method is often used when excavation is not feasible or where soil conditions could be better.

Parameters assessed in soil analysis for solar projects

Soil composition: Soil samples reveal the mineral composition, which provides insights into their mechanical properties and load-bearing capacity.

Soil moisture content: the moisture content can indicate its susceptibility to waterlogging. Squeeze a handful of soil to check if it sticks together and forms a ball.

Soil pH and chemical properties: ideally, soil pH should be within a range suitable for plant growth and structural stability. Conduct a pH test on the soil samples using a pH testing kit.

Soil compaction: evaluating soil compaction levels improves foundation stability and increases solar array lifespan. To perform a compaction test, compact a soil sample.

Soil erosion potential: assess slope, vegetation, and water proximity to prevent soil erosion and structural damage.

Importance of site preparation before installing steel support in solar panels

Structural integrity: soil analysis helps determine the soil's bearing capacity and stability. This is vital for designing the steel support structures holding the solar panels. If the soil is unstable or unable to support the weight of the steel supports and panels, it could lead to structural failure or collapse, posing safety risks and potentially damaging the solar panels.

Optimal performance: proper site preparation ensures the solar panels are installed on a level surface. Uneven terrain can result in uneven weight distribution, affecting the alignment of the panels and potentially reducing their efficiency in capturing sunlight. Additionally, a level surface facilitates easier installation and maintenance of the solar array.

Learn about key cement tests to ensure resilience against extreme weather, moisture ingress, sulphate attack, and other environmental challenges.",Business,3 minutes,cement-durability-tests-for-extreme-weather-conditions,Read now,N/A,N/A,"Cement is indispensable in construction, particularly in India, where varying climatic conditions present significant challenges for builders. For

Indian MSMEs

involved in infrastructure, industrial, or residential projects, ensuring the durability of cement in extreme weather conditions is critical. Whether facing high heat, heavy rainfall, humidity, or even freezing temperatures in certain regions, the cement's ability to endure environmental stressors determines any project's longevity and structural integrity.

Cement's vulnerability to environmental factors

Cement, when mixed with aggregates and water to form concrete, undergoes hydration, initiating its hardening process. However, hardened concrete is vulnerable to several environmental factors that can compromise its long-term durability:

Thermal stress: Prolonged exposure to high temperatures causes expansion in the cement matrix, leading to internal stress and eventual cracking.

Moisture ingress: High humidity or continuous rainfall allows water to permeate the concrete, causing mineral leaching, efflorescence, and structural weakening.

Chemical attack: Saline or sulphate-rich soils or groundwater can chemically react with anhydrate cement present in concrete leading to cracking and losing strength.

Freeze-thaw cycles: In regions where temperatures fluctuate between freezing and thawing, trapped water expands and contracts, causing internal micro-cracking and spalling.

Alkali-silica reaction (ASR): ASR occurs when alkalis in the cement react with reactive silica in aggregates, leading to expansion and cracking in the concrete over time.

The durability tests detailed below address these vulnerabilities, enabling

MSMEs to select cement

that can withstand their region's specific environmental challenges.

Key concrete durability tests for extreme weather conditions 

1. Compressive strength test

The compressive strength test is fundamental for determining how well cement can resist compressive forces without cracking or breaking. In extreme climates, particularly hot regions, thermal expansion can increase internal stress within the concrete. The compressive strength test involves preparing standard mortar cubes, curing them for specific durations (typically 7, 14, and 28 days), and then applying compressive force to evaluate their strength. 

Assessing cement’s compressive strength under elevated temperatures is essential for projects in high-temperature areas. 

Technical insight: Cement that exhibits high compressive strength is better suited for construction in hot regions, where thermal expansion can weaken less robust materials. MSMEs should opt for cement that meets or exceeds strength standards, such as those specified in IS 12269 for 53-grade cement.

2. Water permeability test

Water ingress into the cement matrix is a major concern in regions with high rainfall or humidity. The water permeability test evaluates how well concrete resists water penetration, a key factor in preventing cracking, leaching, and other water-related deterioration. In this test, a cylindrical sample of hardened concrete is exposed to pressurized water, and the penetration depth is measured. 

This test is especially important for structures located in coastal or monsoon-affected regions, where prolonged exposure to water can significantly reduce the durability of concrete. 

Technical insight:

low permeability cement

is critical for reducing moisture ingress, which is particularly essential in coastal areas. Selecting cement with low permeability helps ensure long-term durability and resistance to water-induced damage.

3. Sulphate resistance test

Sulphate-rich environments, often found in coastal or industrial areas, pose a serious threat to cement's durability. Sulphates react with cement compounds, causing expansive reactions that lead to cracking and strength reduction. The sulphate resistance test assesses cement’s ability to withstand exposure to sulphate solutions. Samples are immersed in sulphate-rich environments, and the extent of degradation is measured over time. 

This test is particularly important for construction projects in areas with sulphate-rich soils or water sources, where chemical reactions with the cement could compromise the structure. 

Technical insight: sulphate-resistant cement (SRC), as defined in IS 12330, has lower C3A (tricalcium aluminate) content, which reduces the risk of sulphate attack. MSMEs working in sulphate-rich areas should prioritize using SRC to protect their structures from chemical degradation.

4. Freeze-thaw cycle test

Although freezing temperatures are uncommon across most of India, some northern regions experience cold winters where freeze-thaw cycles can damage concrete. The freeze-thaw cycle test evaluates how well cement withstands repeated freezing and thawing, which can cause water inside the cement matrix to expand and contract, leading to micro-cracks. 

In this test,

cement samples

are subjected to repeated freezing and thawing cycles, and the resulting damage is measured. The test provides insight into the material’s ability to maintain its integrity in cold environments. 

Technical insight: cement containing air-entraining agents, which create microscopic air bubbles within the concrete, shows better freeze-thaw resistance. This allows space for water to expand during freezing, preventing cracking. MSMEs in colder regions should select air-entrained cement per IS 9103 or ASTM C666 standards for freeze-thaw resilience.

5. Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) test

The alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a slow but potentially destructive reaction between reactive silica in aggregates and the

alkalis present in cement

. This reaction leads to expansion and cracking in concrete, particularly in regions with high humidity or heat, which accelerates it.  

The test helps predict the long-term durability of concrete when using aggregates that may contain reactive silica, allowing MSMEs to mitigate risks before project commencement. 

Technical insight: cement with lower alkali content is less likely to trigger ASR, making it suitable for regions prone to this reaction."

Learn about ASR’s causes, effects, and strategies to mitigate damage in concrete structures.",Business,3 minutes,alkali-silica-reaction-in-cement-causes-and-mitigation-strategies,Read now,N/A,N/A,"The alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a significant durability issue in concrete structures, resulting in internal cracking, which compromises structural integrity. ASR is caused by a chemical reaction between the alkali hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) present in

cement and reactive silica

in the aggregates used. This reaction forms an expansive gel that absorbs moisture, leading to internal stresses and cracking of the concrete.

The main factors contributing to ASR include:

Alkali content: high levels of alkalis, usually sodium and potassium oxides present in the cement, increase the pH of the pore solution in the concrete. This high alkalinity facilitates the dissolution of silica from aggregates.

Reactive aggregates: certain aggregates, such as those containing poorly crystalline or amorphous silica, are highly reactive in alkaline conditions. Examples of such aggregates include opal and chalcedony, which are much more reactive than crystalline forms like quartz.

Moisture availability: water is essential for ASR, as the alkali-silica gel absorbs water and swells, leading to cracking. ASR is particularly problematic in structures exposed to humid environments or direct water ingress.

Effects of ASR

The expansion of the ASR gel exerts internal stresses within the concrete matrix, leading to cracking. This process significantly weakens the concrete, making it more porous and allowing further ingress of water and harmful agents, such as chlorides, which can accelerate the corrosion of steel reinforcements. Over time, this deterioration compromises the load-bearing capacity of the structure.

Mitigation Strategies

Mitigating ASR involves addressing one or more of the contributing factors through various strategies:

Low-alkali cement: reducing the alkali content in cement, typically below 0.60% Na₂O equivalent, can limit the potential for ASR. This is one of the most direct methods for preventing ASR in new concrete.

Use of Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs): SCMs, such as fly ash, ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS), and silica fume, can reduce the alkali concentration in the pore solution and lower the pH, making it less conducive to silica dissolution. SCMs rich in aluminum, like metakaolin and fly ash, are particularly effective as they slow down the dissolution of reactive.

Use of non-reactive aggregates: the most straightforward method of preventing ASR is the use of aggregates that are less reactive. Aggregates should be tested for reactivity before being used in concrete mixtures.

Lithium-based admixtures: lithium salts, such as lithium nitrate, can mitigate ASR by stabilizing the silica gel and preventing it from expanding. These admixtures can be used in both the new concrete and the existing structures that are already affected by ASR.

Moisture control: reducing the availability of water to the concrete can limit the expansion of the ASR gel. This can be achieved by using sealants, waterproof membranes, and ensuring good drainage systems around structures to prevent water ingress.

Conclusion

ASR poses a significant risk to the long-term durability of concrete structures, especially those exposed to moist environments. By understanding the causes of ASR and implementing effective mitigation strategies—such as using

low-alkali cement

, SCMs, non-reactive aggregates, and lithium-based admixtures—the detrimental effects of ASR can be controlled. Continued research and advancements in testing and modelling will further aid in preventing ASR-related damage in concrete structures."

, though it may be prone to cracking due to rapid hydration.

Versatility: OPC is widely used in various construction projects, from residential to commercial buildings.

2. Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) 

Chemical composition:

Contains the same base components as OPC, with added pozzolanic materials like fly ash, volcanic ash, or silica fumes (15-35%).

Effect on construction:

Durability: the pozzolanic materials react with calcium hydroxide, improving durability and making PPC more resistant to chemical attacks. This is useful in structures exposed to water or chemicals, like dams or marine structures.

Workability:

PPC

has finer particles, improving workability, which is advantageous in plastering or finishing works.

Lower heat of hydration: PPC generates less heat during curing, reducing the risk of cracks in large concrete structures such as dams and bridges.

3. Rapid Hardening Cement (RHC)

Limited use: due to its fast-setting time, RHC is not suitable for large projects requiring longer working periods.

4. Sulphate-Resistant Cement (SRC) 

Chemical composition:

Reduced levels of tricalcium aluminate (C₃A), typically less than 5%.

Effect on construction:

Resistant to sulphates: SRC is specifically designed to resist sulphate attacks, which can damage concrete in sulphate-rich soils or water. It is ideal for foundations, sewage plants, and underground structures.

Longer lifespan: it improves the durability of structures in harsh environments, especially coastal areas where exposure to sulphates can compromise ordinary cement.

5. Low Heat Cement (LHC) 

Chemical composition:

Lower content of tricalcium silicate (C₃S) and tricalcium aluminate (C₃A). 

Higher content of dicalcium silicate (C₂S).

Effect on construction:

Minimised heat generation: LHC produces less heat during hydration, making it suitable for large concrete structures like dams where excessive heat can cause cracks.

Slower setting time: LHC sets slower, allowing more controlled hardening, which is beneficial for large-scale projects requiring gradual strength development.

6. White Cement

pmXxYsED6bNhuPXXZG0b6,What is the benefit of trade accounts receivable?,What is the Benefit of Trade Accounts Receivable? | JSW One MSME Blog,"Learn how trade accounts receivable can improve liquidity, support growth, and strengthen customer relationships by offering flexible payment terms.",Business,3 minutes,what-is-the-benefit-of-trade-accounts-receivable,Read now,N/A,N/A,"Many

Indian MSMEs

face significant cash flow challenges, especially in manufacturing and construction. This often happens because client payments are delayed for 60 to 90 days while businesses must continue purchasing materials and covering day-to-day expenses. As a result, MSMEs usually struggle with liquidity, slowing down their operations and even delaying project completion. This cash flow gap can hinder growth and create financial stress, especially when upfront payments for materials like steel or machinery are required. 

Trade accounts receivable effectively solves this cash flow issue.

trade accounts receivable

allows MSMEs to sell materials or services on credit and collect payments after 30 to 90 days. This gives businesses more time to manage their finances, align customer payments with their operational costs, and avoid upfront expenses.

How trade accounts receivable solves the problem:

Improved cash flow: MSMEs can maintain liquidity by delaying customer payments, allowing them to continue operations without waiting for cash up front.

Increased sales: offering credit terms attracts customers who prefer flexible payments, leading to higher sales.

Stronger customer relationships: giving customers the flexibility of credit builds loyalty and repeat business.

Growth opportunities: trade accounts receivable frees up working capital, allowing MSMEs to take on more projects and grow their businesses.

Case Study: Shree Constructions Pvt Ltd

Company background

Shree Constructions is a mid-sized Indian construction firm specialising in large infrastructure and commercial building projects. Like many MSMEs, the company heavily relies on consistent access to raw materials like steel, cement, and concrete to keep its projects on track.

The problem

Shree Constructions faced severe cash flow problems. Their projects were large and required substantial upfront investment in materials. For instance, the company regularly purchased steel worth ₹10 lakhs per month to maintain project timelines. However, with client payments delayed by up to 90 days, Shree Constructions struggled to balance operational expenses, including paying for materials, labour, and overhead costs.

Key issues they faced:

Liquidity crunch: client's 90-day payment cycle left a significant gap between outflows (material and labour costs) and inflows (client payments). 

Delayed project timelines: despite consistent cash flow, the company sometimes could not procure the necessary materials on time, leading to project delays. 

Growth constraints: cash flow issues limited the company's ability to take on more projects, stifling its growth potential.

The solution: trade accounts receivable

To resolve these cash flow challenges, Shree Constructions negotiated a trade accounts receivable agreement with one of its key suppliers. The terms allowed Shree Constructions to purchase steel on a 60-day credit basis, meaning they could take delivery of the materials and delay payment for two months. This arrangement helped bridge the gap between their supplier's payment obligations and the time it took to receive client payments.

The specific terms of the trade accounts receivable agreement were:

60-day payment terms for steel purchases worth ₹10 lakhs per month. There are no upfront payments, allowing the company to allocate its limited cash resources to other operational needs like labour and equipment.

The impact

Shree Constructions began using trade accounts receivable in early 2023, and within a few months, they saw significant improvements in their financial health and project efficiency.

Improved cash flow

Over one quarter, the company purchased ₹30 lakhs worth of steel on credit. The 60-day payment terms meant that Shree Constructions no longer had to pay immediately for materials.

Risk management

While trade accounts receivable introduced the risk of defaulting on supplier payments, Shree Constructions carefully managed this by monitoring its accounts receivable from clients. It implemented stricter credit control measures and followed up more rigorously on client payments, ensuring it could always meet its supplier obligations within the 60-day window. 

In the event of client delays, the company set aside a portion of its existing cash reserves as a buffer to cover unforeseen gaps in payments. 

If you're dealing with customers who regularly pay late and require frequent reminders, you may be better off discontinuing their service. Evaluate the financial risk associated with their late or non-payments to decide if retaining them is beneficial. Alternatively, you could request that they pay in advance rather than extending credit to them."

Here are keyways in which

steel reinforcement strengthens

these structures:

1. Tensile strength and load distribution

Steel is renowned for its high tensile strength, which makes it a key material for handling the loads applied to ground-mounted solar panels. Steel's ability to resist bending or breaking under tension ensures that the solar structure can support the weight of the panels without sagging or collapsing. Steel is used in the frames, racking, and foundations in ground-mounted systems, offering a robust framework that distributes weight evenly across the structure. 

For example, in utility-scale solar farms,

hot-dip galvanised steel

is often used because it provides both the strength to support large arrays and protection against environmental degradation.

Steel's tensile strength

allows it to handle wind loads, which are often a concern in open, exposed areas where solar panels are installed.

2. Corrosion resistance for longevity

Corrosion is a significant issue for outdoor structures, particularly those exposed to varying weather conditions. Steel used in solar mounting systems is typically galvanised, meaning it is coated with zinc to prevent rust and corrosion. Galvanised steel provides excellent resistance to corrosion, which extends the lifespan of solar installations by preventing deterioration of the metal. The zinc layer acts as a barrier, protecting the steel from moisture and other corrosive elements in the atmosphere.

3. Foundation stability with steel piles

One of the most critical components in ground-mounted solar systems is the foundation, where steel piles or posts are often driven deep into the ground. These piles provide structural stability by anchoring the entire system. Steel piles are designed to handle vertical loads from the weight of the panels and lateral forces from wind or seismic events.

Steel piles

are often driven several meters deep, depending on soil conditions and wind loads, ensuring the mounting system is securely anchored. The piles can also be installed using driven pile systems or screw piles, depending on the site conditions. Screw piles offer flexibility in difficult terrains and are easy to install without extensive ground disturbance

4. Wind load resistance

Solar panels installed on the ground are exposed to significant wind loads, which can cause vibrations or even displacement if not properly accounted for. Steel reinforcement, particularly in the framing and foundation, ensures that the structure remains stable during high wind events. The

steel framing

is designed to resist uplift forces, which occur when wind exerts upward pressure on the panels.

5. Optimisation for tilt and sun exposure

Steel reinforcement

is also critical in ensuring that ground-mounted solar panels are positioned at the optimal tilt angle for maximum sunlight exposure. Steel racking systems allow for precise adjustment of the panel angles, ensuring that they can capture the most sunlight throughout the day. High-quality steel ensures these systems remain stable over time, preventing any sagging or movement that could alter the panel's orientation."

Discover how MSMEs can mitigate recall risks by leveraging premium steel to enhance component durability.",Product,3 minutes,how-msmes-can-leverage-high-quality-steel-to-reduce-vehicle-recall-risks,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"The Indian automotive industry has faced growing vehicle recalls, with 5.4 million cars recalled since 2012. In 2023 alone, 284,906 vehicles were recalled, including both passenger cars and two-wheelers. These recalls, driven by defects in components such as airbags, brakes, and fuel systems, pose serious financial and reputational risks to manufacturers. For

MSMEs

that supply parts to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), minimising the risk of vehicle recalls is crucial to maintaining business relationships and competitiveness in a highly demanding market. 

Steel, particularly in engine and transmission systems, plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability and safety of vehicles. Here's how

MSMEs can leverage premium steel

to mitigate risks and enhance their production standards.

Maximising strength and durability of critical components

Automotive parts such as crankshafts, gears, and connecting rods endure extreme stress and pressure during vehicle operation. These components must resist fatigue and, torsional stress and wear to function properly over a long lifespan. High-quality alloy steels, such as chromium-molybdenum (Cr-Mo) steel or carbon-manganese (C-Mn) steel, improve these parts' overall durability and strength. Steel alloys treated with quenching and tempering can achieve higher levels of hardness and toughness, significantly reducing the risk of cracks, deformations, or failures under stress.

Enhancing precision in manufacturing

Defects in components often result from manufacturing inconsistencies, such as poor dimensional accuracy or improper fitting. This has been a key cause of several recalls in India, where defective parts like airbag controllers or brake systems have prompted large-scale remedial actions . High-quality steel allows for better cutting, forming, and welding precision, reducing production errors.

Reducing corrosion risks

In India, recalls have been triggered by rusting or corrosion in parts like fuel tanks and brake lines . Corrosion weakens the structural integrity of these components, making them prone to failure, which can have catastrophic safety implications. 

By using corrosion-resistant materials such as

stainless steel

or steel alloys treated with anti-corrosion coatings, MSMEs can significantly reduce the risk of rust formation. Stainless steel, for example, contains chromium, which forms a passive layer of chromium oxide on the surface, protecting the steel from oxidation and corrosion. This makes it an ideal material for components like exhaust systems, brake lines, and fuel tanks, which are frequently exposed to moisture, chemicals, and fluctuating temperatures.

Improving performance under thermal stress

Automotive components like exhaust valves, pistons, and cylinder heads are exposed to extreme heat during engine operation. Repeated exposure to high temperatures can cause materials to weaken, leading to cracks or failures. This was the case in some recalls related to fuel injection systems and brake components that failed under thermal stress . Heat-treated steel, which undergoes processes like annealing, normalising, or tempering, offers better resistance to high temperatures. These treatments alter the microstructure of the

steel

, improving its ability to retain strength and hardness at elevated temperatures.

Ensuring compliance with evolving safety standards

As the Indian automotive market matures, there is increasing pressure on OEMs to meet stringent safety and quality standards. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways introduced updated recall policies in 2021, which impose fines up to ₹1 crore on manufacturers for failing to address safety issues . This places a greater responsibility on MSMEs to deliver high-quality, defect-free components that comply with the latest safety regulations.

Enhancing product lifespan and reducing maintenance costs

Using high-quality steel helps prevent recalls and extends the lifespan of automotive components. Parts made from durable,

corrosion-resistant, and heat-treated steel

require less frequent replacement, reducing maintenance costs for vehicle owners. In turn, this can enhance customer satisfaction and strengthen the reputation of the MSMEs and the OEMs they supply.

Conclusion

By investing in

high-quality steel

, MSMEs can ensure that their parts meet the stringent safety and durability requirements of OEMs and regulatory bodies. This reduces the chances of recalls, which not only affect the reputation of the OEM but also have a cascading impact on the MSME suppliers involved in producing defective parts."

in engine components and how it is applied in various critical engine parts.

What is heat-treated steel?

Heat treatment involves heating and cooling steel to alter its internal structure and improve its mechanical properties. The process is carefully controlled, and the most common types of heat treatment include:

Annealing: Softens the metal for improved ductility and workability.

Quenching: Rapidly cools the steel, increasing its hardness and strength.

Tempering: Reduces brittleness after quenching, improving toughness.

Normalising: Cools the steel in the air to enhance uniformity and strength.

Surface hardening: Hardens the steel's outer layer while keeping the core tough, increasing wear resistance.

These treatments enhance steel's performance, making it ideal for engine components that must withstand high pressure, stress, and temperature.

Benefits of heat-treated steel in engine components

1. Increased hardness and strength

Engine components, such as crankshafts and connecting rods, face heavy loads and must be incredibly strong. Heat-treated steel increases these parts' hardness and tensile strength, making them more resistant to mechanical stress and less prone to deformation or failure.

2. Improved wear resistance

Engine parts such as gears, valve seats, and camshafts endure constant friction, which can lead to wear over time. Heat treatment, particularly surface hardening, enhances wear resistance, helping these components last longer under tough operating conditions.

3. Enhanced fatigue resistance

Engine components undergo repeated stress cycles, which can lead to fatigue failure. Heat treatment reduces

internal stresses in steel

, making it more fatigue resistant. This is particularly important for parts like connecting rods and crankshafts that operate under continuous stress.

4. Thermal stability

Many engine components, such as exhaust valves and piston rings, are exposed to high temperatures. Heat-treated steel can withstand these extreme temperatures without losing strength or deforming, making it the ideal material for high-heat applications.

5. Longer component lifespan

Heat treatment extends the service life of engine components by increasing the durability and resistance of steel. This reduces the frequency of repairs and replacements, saving costs and improving the overall efficiency of manufacturing operations.

Applications of heat-treated steel in engine components

1. Crankshafts

Crankshafts convert the up-and-down motion of the pistons into rotational motion. These parts face immense mechanical stress and need to be exceptionally strong. Heat-treated steel, especially quenched and tempered steel, is used to improve the crankshaft's toughness and wear resistance, ensuring long-lasting performance.

2. Camshafts

Camshafts control the movement of engine valves. These components are exposed to significant friction, especially at high speeds, making wear resistance crucial. Camshafts are typically surface-hardened to extend their lifespan while maintaining the toughness required for optimal performance.

3. Connecting rods

Connecting rods transfer motion between the pistons and the crankshaft. They experience intense compressive and tensile forces, making them prone to fatigue. Heat-treated steel improves their strength, fatigue resistance, and ability to handle high mechanical loads.

4. Gears

Gears inside an engine transmit power and experience constant friction. Heat-treated steel gears benefit from surface hardening, which increases their wear resistance and ensures they can handle high torque and mechanical loads over time.

5. Valves and valve seats

Exhaust valves are exposed to extreme temperatures and high-speed impacts, making heat resistance and toughness essential. Heat treatment ensures that valves and valve seats maintain their shape and sealing properties, even after long exposure to high temperatures.

6. Piston rings

Piston rings seal the combustion chamber, control oil consumption, and endure significant heat and pressure. Heat-treated steel piston rings have better wear resistance and thermal stability, ensuring efficient operation and extended engine life.

7. Cylinder liners

Cylinder liners form the inner walls of engine cylinders where pistons move. These components are subjected to constant friction and high heat. Heat-treated steel cylinder liners offer increased wear resistance, reducing the likelihood of friction-induced damage and extending engine performance.

Conclusion

Heat-treated steel is essential for manufacturing durable, high-performance engine components. Its ability to improve hardness, wear resistance, fatigue strength, and thermal stability makes it an ideal material for parts such as crankshafts, gears, camshafts, and valves. For

Indian MSMEs in the automotive sector

",Business,3 minutes,best-practices-for-welding-steel-in-auto-parts-manufacturing,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Welding plays a crucial role in auto parts manufacturing, particularly for

Indian MSMEs

focused on quality and durability in steel components. Steel remains a primary material in vehicle construction, so precise welding ensures robust, long-lasting parts. This blog offers insights into best practices for welding steel aimed at MSMEs.

Select the right welding process

In auto parts manufacturing, different welding techniques are used based on the type of steel and component. Below are the commonly employed methods:

MIG Welding (Metal Inert Gas): Ideal for high-volume production, MIG welding involves a wire-fed process, making it faster and suitable for joining thicker metals. It is widely used in automotive manufacturing for components such as body panels and interior parts. Try

Ador Automig-1 ER70S-6 C-Mn Steel MIG Welding Wire

, available on the JSW One platform, for a reliable process.

TIG Welding (Tungsten Inert Gas): TIG welding produces precise, clean welds, especially for thin, intricate parts. It’s frequently used for smaller, more delicate automotive parts, such as pipes and fuel tanks. For this purpose, Ador Tigfil ER70S-2 C-Mn Steel TIG Welding Wire is an excellent choice.

Resistance Spot Welding: Often used for joining sheet metal in cars, spot welding is highly efficient, ensuring fast production. It is typically employed for tasks such as welding chassis components and body frames.

Choose the appropriate welding consumables

Selecting the right welding consumables is vital for ensuring strong, durable welds. When welding mild steel, consumables like

Ador Kingbond S E6013 Mild Steel Welding Electrode

are recommended for general-purpose welding tasks, providing a smooth, stable arc. For carbon-manganese (C-Mn) steel, Ador Automelt EM12K C-Mn Steel SAW Welding Wire offers superior performance in submerged arc welding applications, ensuring high deposition efficiency. 

For projects requiring stainless steel welding, opt for the Ador Superinox 2A E316-16 Stainless Steel Welding Electrode. This electrode offers excellent corrosion resistance, making it ideal for automotive components exposed to harsh conditions.

Follow proper safety protocols

Safety should be a top priority when welding steel in auto manufacturing. Ensure that all workers are equipped with proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, helmets, and goggles. Welding produces harmful fumes, so it is essential to maintain proper ventilation in the workspace. Additionally, fire prevention measures, such as having fire extinguishers nearby, should be in place at all times.

Control heat input to prevent warping

Automotive parts, especially those made from thinner steel sheets, can warp due to excessive heat input during welding. A common technique to mitigate this is skip welding, where welds are spaced out to distribute heat evenly. This method allows the workpiece to cool between welds, preventing distortion. 

For added control, using a smaller diameter welding wire can help. For example, in MIG welding, a 0.8 mm wire such as

Ador Automig-1 ER70S-6 C-Mn Steel MIG Welding Wire

helps minimise heat input while maintaining the integrity of the weld.

Clean and prepare surfaces before welding

A clean surface is critical for producing strong welds. Any dirt, oil, or rust on the steel can compromise the weld, leading to weak joints. Always ensure that the welding area is thoroughly cleaned using a wire brush or degreaser before starting. This simple step significantly reduces the chances of defects and ensures a smooth, durable weld.

Use the correct power settings

Thin a

utomotive steel sheets

can easily be damaged if the welding machine is set to a high-power level. Always begin with a lower power setting, particularly when welding thinner materials, to avoid burning through the metal. This approach helps achieve cleaner, more precise welds without compromising the material’s strength.

Employ backing bars for better heat dissipation

When welding delicate or heat-sensitive auto parts, a backing bar can prevent overheating and reduce the risk of warping. A backing bar, often made from copper or aluminium, is clamped to the workpiece to quickly dissipate heat, resulting in a more controlled welding process.

Test and inspect welds

After welding, it is critical to inspect the joints for quality. Techniques such as non-destructive testing (NDT), including visual inspection and ultrasonic testing, can help identify potential defects, such as cracks or weak points. This step is essential in ensuring that the welded parts meet the required strength and safety standards for automotive use.

Conclusion

By carefully selecting the appropriate welding process—be it MIG for high-volume applications or TIG for precision work—

businesses can optimise

their operations based on the specific requirements of different components. In addition, controlling heat input, maintaining clean surfaces, and utilising backing bars are all crucial for avoiding defects such as warping and weak welds, particularly in thin automotive steel parts."
3mV9jNOek2QNQnCPO8WFjY,Impact of TMT bar grades on seismic performance in high-risk zones,Impact of TMT Bar Grades on Seismic Performance in High-risk Zones | JSW One MSME Blog,"Explore the role of TMT bars in seismic zone construction. Learn how selecting the right TMT bar grades, like Fe 500D and Fe 550D, enhances the earthquake resistance of structures in high-risk seismic zones in India.",Product,3 minutes,impact-of-tmt-bar-grades-on-seismic-performance-in-high-risk-zones,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"India is divided into four seismic zones—II, III, IV, and V—based on the likelihood of seismic activity, with zone V representing the highest risk. Structures in zones IV and V are subjected to significant seismic forces that induce lateral loads and cause material strain. The design of

earthquake-resistant structures

requires materials that can handle such dynamic loads while maintaining structural integrity.

TMT bars

serve as the primary reinforcement in concrete structures, providing tensile strength to counteract the compressive forces in concrete. In seismic conditions, these bars must possess high tensile strength and demonstrate excellent ductility to absorb and dissipate energy from seismic waves. The grade of TMT bars used significantly influences these properties.

Mechanical properties of TMT bars relevant to seismic design

TMT bars are classified into different grades based on their yield strength, which directly impacts a structure's load-bearing capacity. Common grades in the Indian construction sector include Fe 415, Fe 500,

Fe 550

, and Fe 600. These grades indicate the minimum yield strength in megapascals (MPa). However, yield strength alone does not provide sufficient information for seismic design. Ductility and elongation percentages are equally important factors.

Yield strength vs ductility

Yield strength: higher yield strength allows the bars to withstand greater loads. However, bars with excessively high yield strength may become brittle beyond a certain threshold, which is detrimental in seismic events. Brittle failure leads to sudden structural collapse, whereas ductile failure provides warning signs, allowing for evacuations.

Ductility: ductility, expressed as elongation percentage, determines the bar’s ability to undergo plastic deformation before fracture. This is critical in seismic zones, as ductile bars absorb seismic energy by bending without breaking. Ductility is particularly crucial in high-seismic zones (IV and V), where structures experience repeated loading cycles.

TMT bar grades and their suitability in seismic zones

Fe 415

Fe 415 bars are primarily used in low-seismic zones or for structures that do not require high load-bearing capacity. With a yield strength of 415 MPa and moderate elasticity, Fe 415 is typically applied in residential or low-rise buildings. These bars provide sufficient flexibility for regions where seismic forces are minimal. However, their lower strength makes them unsuitable for high-seismic zones requiring greater tensile strength and energy absorption.

Fe 500

Fe 500 is India's most used grade, offering a balance between strength (500 MPa yield strength) and ductility. It is suitable for medium to high-rise buildings in seismic zones III and IV. Fe 500’s elongation percentage (typically 12–16%) ensures sufficient plastic deformation under seismic loads, making it suitable for moderate earthquake resistance. This grade provides the necessary tensile strength while maintaining flexibility to avoid brittle failure during seismic events.

Fe 550

Fe 550 TMT bars

provide a higher yield strength of 550 MPa, which allows them to support greater loads. However, their ductility is slightly lower compared to Fe 500 bars. They are often used in industrial structures, bridges, and infrastructure projects where load-bearing capacity is prioritised over flexibility. Fe 550 bars are suitable only in seismic zones IV and V if combined with design strategies that account for their reduced ductility, such as confining reinforcement and joint detailing, to enhance the building’s overall seismic resilience.

Fe 600

Fe 600 bars, with a yield strength of 600 MPa, are the strongest among the commonly used TMT grades. However, they have a lower elongation percentage and are less ductile compared to Fe 500 and Fe 550. These bars are better suited for non-seismic applications such as high-rise buildings or structures requiring high load-bearing capacity but located in low-seismic regions. In earthquake-prone areas, the risk of brittle failure in Fe 600 bars outweighs their benefits, making them inappropriate for seismic design.

Role of Fe 500D and Fe 550D in seismic zones

In seismic engineering, the 'D', the Fe 500D and Fe 550D designation, stands for ductility. These bars are specifically designed to provide enhanced performance in seismic conditions. They have higher elongation percentages than their standard counterparts, making them more suited for earthquake-prone zones.

Fe 500D: With a yield strength of 500 MPa and an elongation percentage of around 18%,

Fe 500D offers an ideal balance

of strength and ductility for buildings in zones IV and V. It absorbs seismic energy more efficiently and provides better deformation capacity, reducing the likelihood of catastrophic failure. Fe 500D is the preferred choice for most earthquake-resistant structures, offering superior seismic performance compared to standard Fe 500 bars.

Fe 550D: Similar to

Fe 500D

, Fe 550D bars improve over standard Fe 550 in ductility, with an elongation percentage of around 14–16%. While they offer higher yield strength, their application in seismic zones should be carefully considered, and they are best suited for heavy-duty industrial structures where additional load-bearing capacity is essential.

Seismic design considerations for MSMEs

For MSMEs involved in construction, especially in zones IV and V, using TMT bars with higher ductility is crucial for meeting seismic design standards. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) recommends the use of higher-ductility TMT bars such as

Fe 500D

or

Fe 550D

in earthquake-prone areas. These bars, when combined with proper design practices—such as the use of shear walls, braced frames, and appropriate foundation designs—can significantly enhance a building’s ability to withstand seismic forces. MSMEs constructing in high-risk seismic zones should ensure that their projects comply with IS 13920:1993 (Ductile Detailing of Reinforced Concrete Structures Subjected to Seismic Forces), which mandates the use of ductile TMT bars and provides guidelines for reinforcement detailing to ensure improved energy dissipation during seismic events.

Conclusion

The selection of

TMT bar grades

is a critical decision for MSMEs operating in high-risk seismic zones. While higher-strength TMT bars like Fe 550 and Fe 600 provide increased load-bearing capacity, their reduced ductility makes them less suitable for earthquake-resistant construction. In contrast, Fe 500D and

Fe 550D

bars offer the necessary balance of strength and ductility, ensuring optimal seismic performance."

Steel trusses are often a key component in PEB roofs because of their strength, load distribution capabilities, and adaptability. For Indian MSMEs engaged in construction and manufacturing, especially those using the

JSW One MSME

platform to procure materials, understanding the technical

benefits of steel trusses

is essential for ensuring the structural reliability of their projects.

What are steel trusses?

Steel trusses are structural frameworks made of triangular units connected by straight steel members. The triangular design distributes forces efficiently, allowing the even transfer of loads throughout the structure. In roof applications, trusses support the weight of the roofing material and additional loads like wind, snow, and live loads (such as maintenance personnel).

This makes them particularly suitable for long-span roof structures, such as those found in warehouses, factories, and industrial sheds.

Key technical benefits of steel trusses in PEB roof structures

Optimised load distribution

In roof structures, the forces acting on the roof are transferred along the truss members, distributing both compression and tension forces across the entire structure. This prevents stress concentrations, which can cause deformation or structural failure over time. Proper load distribution is especially important in large-span roofs, as it reduces the need for internal columns and maximises usable space.

For PEBs, steel trusses allow for the construction of wide, open areas without the need for multiple support points. This is particularly useful in industrial buildings.

High strength-to-weight ratio

Steel trusses have a high strength-to-weight ratio, providing significant structural strength without adding too much weight to the building. This reduces the overall load on the building’s foundation and allows for the use of lighter roofing materials. The lower deadload results in cost savings on materials and labour, as lighter roofs are easier to install and require less structural support.

Compared to heavier materials like concrete or timber trusses, steel trusses require fewer substantial foundations and columns, lowering overall construction costs and reducing project timelines.

Long-span capabilities

Long-span trusses are essential for industrial buildings where large, uninterrupted spaces are required for storage, manufacturing, or moving machinery. Certain trusses, such as the pratt, howe, and warren trusses, are particularly effective in long-span applications. Depending on design and load requirements, these trusses can span 20 to over 100 metres. MSMEs engaged in industrial or warehousing projects can use

long-span steel trusses

to design functional spaces that optimise operations and reduce construction costs.

Resistance to environmental factors

Steel trusses, especially those treated with anti-corrosion coatings like galvanisation or zinc-rich primers, offer excellent resistance to environmental factors such as moisture, humidity, and chemical exposure. This is particularly important for PEBs in coastal regions or industrial environments where exposure to corrosive elements can weaken the structure over time.

Galvanised steel trusses, for instance, have a protective layer that prevents rusting and corrosion, extending the lifespan of the roof structure. MSMEs can reduce long-term maintenance costs by choosing corrosion-resistant steel trusses and ensuring their PEBs retain structural integrity in harsh environments.

Ease of installation and flexibility

Steel trusses are typically prefabricated off-site and delivered to the construction site ready for assembly. This reduces on-site labour and speeds up the construction process, which is especially beneficial in projects with tight timelines. The modular design of steel trusses also provides flexibility, as they can be customised to meet the project's specific needs, whether it involves varying load requirements or unconventional roof shapes.

For MSMEs working on construction projects, the ease of installation leads to faster project completion and lower labour costs without compromising quality.

Types of steel trusses used in PEB roofs

Several types of steel trusses are commonly used in PEB roof systems, each suitable for different load and span requirements:

Pratt truss: this design features diagonals that slope toward the centre of the truss and vertical members that provide additional support. Pratt trusses are efficient for long spans and are widely used in industrial buildings. The design allows for effective handling of both tension and compression forces.

Howe truss: the diagonals in a Howe truss slope away from the centre, making this truss ideal for supporting heavy vertical loads. It is particularly suited to areas where snow loads are a concern.

Warren truss: the Warren truss has a series of equilateral triangles, which provide uniform load distribution. This truss type is suitable for dynamic loads, making it ideal for industrial facilities where machinery movement or vibrations occur.

Fink truss: the fink truss is characterised by additional diagonal members, creating smaller triangular sections. This design increases its load-bearing capacity, making it suitable for roofs supporting heavy equipment like HVAC systems or solar panels.

Considerations for MSMEs when selecting steel trusses

When choosing

steel trusses

for

PEB projects

, MSMEs should consider the following factors:

Design loads: the trusses must be designed to handle all expected loads, including dead loads (roof material weight), live loads, and environmental loads such as wind or snow.

Span length: longer spans require stronger truss designs. The choice of truss should align with the project's span and load requirements.

Material quality: the steel should meet the necessary standards for tensile strength, corrosion resistance, and durability. MSMEs should procure certified materials from reliable platforms like

JSW One MSME

.

Environmental exposure: in regions with high humidity or corrosive conditions, MSMEs should choose

galvanised steel trusses

for long-term protection against environmental degradation."

What MSMEs should look for

Choosing suppliers that provide certified, high-quality steel is important when purchasing steel online. Platforms like

JSW One MSME

offer materials that meet industry standards ensuring the steel you buy is suitable for PEB applications. Compliance certificates and test reports should be available with each order to confirm the steel's quality.

Precision in fabrication

Fabrication involves cutting, drilling, and welding steel components to match the exact specifications of the PEB design. Even small errors in fabrication can lead to misalignment during the building's assembly, which can cause structural instability, delays in construction, and increased costs.

Why precision matters

For PEBs, components must be precisely fabricated to fit together seamlessly during assembly. Quality control during fabrication uses advanced techniques like CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines to accurately cut and drill steel. MSMEs buying steel online should ensure that the steel is fabricated to precise dimensions, as any discrepancies could result in problems during construction. Opting for trusted platforms that provide precision in

steel fabrication

can reduce on-site errors and delays.

Welding quality and structural integrity

Welded joints are critical to the integrity of a PEB structure. Poor-quality welds can result in weak points that compromise the building’s ability to handle loads such as wind or seismic forces. Quality control at this stage involves inspecting welds to ensure they are free from defects such as cracks, incomplete penetration, or porosity.

What MSMEs should expect

When buying

steel for PEBs

, particularly if the components come prefabricated with welded connections, MSMEs should check for compliance with welding standards like AWS (American Welding Society) or IS 9595. Ensuring that the welds have been inspected through non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques, such as ultrasonic or radiographic testing, guarantees the structure’s durability. If purchasing prefabricated components online, ask for NDT reports or certifications as part of your quality assurance process.

Surface treatment and corrosion protection

PEBs are often exposed to harsh environmental conditions, including moisture, humidity, and chemical exposure, which can lead to corrosion. Steel components need to be treated with anti-corrosion coatings like galvanisation or zinc-rich primers to ensure longevity. Surface preparation, which includes cleaning and removing impurities, is critical to ensure that coatings adhere properly.

Protecting your investment

MSMEs buying steel online should ensure that the steel components have been treated with high-quality anti-corrosion coatings, especially if their PEB project is in coastal or industrial areas with higher corrosion risks.

Galvanised steel

, for example, provides a protective layer that helps prevent rust and corrosion. When buying steel from platforms like JSW One MSME, verify that the materials have undergone proper surface preparation and coating processes to ensure long-term durability.

Load-bearing capacity and testing

PEBs must be able to withstand various loads, including the structure's weight (dead loads), external forces like wind and snow (live loads), and dynamic loads such as seismic activity. Ensuring that the steel components can bear these loads is critical to quality control. Finite element analysis (FEA) and physical load testing often simulate and verify how components behave under different conditions.

Making informed decisions

MSMEs buying

steel online

should look for suppliers that perform comprehensive load testing and provide data on the steel's load-bearing capacity. Platforms that offer test reports, performance data, and design certifications help ensure that the steel you buy will perform as expected once it is part of the PEB structure. This step can prevent unexpected failures during construction or use.

Assembly and connection accuracy

A key component of PEB quality control is ensuring that all bolted and welded connections are assembled correctly during manufacturing. Improperly tightened bolts or misaligned components can cause structural issues, such as movement under load or uneven stress distribution. Quality control processes ensure all connections meet specific torque or tension requirements.

Why this matters to MSMEs

steel

’s role in the warehouse industry is indispensable. Here’s a closer look at how steel contributes to the structural integrity of warehouses and why it is considered an ideal material for this purpose.

1. Exceptional strength-to-weight ratio

One of steel's standout features is its high strength-to-weight ratio, meaning it can support substantial loads without adding excessive weight to the structure. This is particularly advantageous for warehouse construction, where large spans and open spaces are required for optimal storage solutions. Using steel allows for lighter structures without compromising strength, making it easier to construct large, open floor plans without requiring numerous supporting columns. This not only maximises storage capacity but also improves the efficiency of warehouse operations by facilitating the easy movement of goods and machinery.

2. Superior durability and longevity

Steel is renowned for its durability and resistance to various environmental factors, including moisture, pests, and extreme weather conditions. Unlike wood, which can deteriorate over time due to rot or insect damage, steel remains stable and robust, ensuring a long lifespan with minimal maintenance. This durability is particularly important in the warehouse industry, where structures must withstand heavy use and exposure to potentially harsh environments. Steel’s ability to maintain its structural integrity over time reduces the need for frequent repairs or replacements, making it a cost-effective choice in the long run.

3. Flexibility in design and adaptability

The flexibility of steel as a construction material allows for versatile design options. Steel structures can be customised to meet specific needs, whether creating expansive clear spans without intermediate supports or designing for future expansion. This adaptability is a significant advantage for warehouses, as it allows businesses to easily modify or expand their facilities as their storage requirements change. Additionally, steel’s ability to be shaped into various forms enables architects to design both functional and aesthetically pleasing warehouses, catering to the specific needs of different industries.

4. Quick and efficient construction

Steel structures

offer faster construction times than traditional building materials. Prefabricated steel components can be manufactured off-site to precise specifications and quickly assembled on-site. This process significantly reduces construction time and labour costs, allowing warehouses to be built and operational quickly. The speed of construction is critical for businesses looking to expand or establish new storage facilities rapidly, ensuring minimal disruption to their operations.

5. Excellent fire resistance

Steel is a non-combustible material, which makes it an excellent choice for warehouses, particularly those storing flammable or hazardous materials.

For MSMEs that purchase steel online, understanding how to protect steel from corrosion is essential to ensure the longevity and durability of their structures. By carefully selecting materials such as hot-rolled steel, Pre-Painted Galvalume Steel (PPGL), Galvalume Steel (GL), and Galvanised Plain Steel (GP) and applying the right treatments, you can effectively mitigate the risk of corrosion. Here are some tips and techniques for protecting steel structures from corrosion.

1. Choosing the right material

Selecting the appropriate type of steel is the first line of defence against corrosion. Different steel materials offer varying levels of resistance based on their composition and coatings:

Hot-rolled steel: while

hot-rolled steel

is known for its strength and malleability, it is also more prone to corrosion if left untreated. Applying protective coatings or galvanising hot-rolled steel can significantly enhance its rust resistance and extend its lifespan, especially in outdoor or humid environments.

PPGL:

pre-painted galvalume steel

is coated with zinc and then painted to add an extra layer of protection against corrosion. The zinc coating acts as a sacrificial layer, protecting the steel from rust by corroding in place of the underlying metal. The additional paint layer provides further protection and can be customised to meet aesthetic requirements while enhancing durability.

Gl:

galvalume steel

is coated with an alloy of aluminium and zinc, providing excellent resistance to corrosion. The aluminium in the coating enhances its ability to withstand oxidation and rust, making it a great choice for environments with high humidity or salinity, such as coastal areas. Galvalume steel balances corrosion resistance and aesthetic appeal with a smooth, reflective surface.

GP: galvanised plain steel is coated with a layer of zinc to protect against corrosion. This material is cost-effective and protects environments with moderate exposure to corrosive elements. The zinc coating is a barrier that prevents moisture and oxygen from reaching the steel, reducing the risk of rust.

2. Applying protective coatings

Applying protective coatings to steel surfaces is a proven method for preventing corrosion. Different coatings can provide varying levels of protection based on the specific environmental conditions and the type of steel being used:

Galvanising: this process involves coating steel with a layer of zinc, which acts as a protective barrier against corrosion. The zinc coating provides physical protection and serves as a sacrificial anode, corroding in place of the steel. Galvanised steel, including galvanised iron (GI) sheets, is widely used in construction due to its enhanced durability and corrosion resistance.

Paint coatings: using high-quality paints and primers designed for steel can provide a robust barrier against moisture and oxygen.

Paint coatings

are particularly effective when combined with galvanised or galvalume steel, offering an additional layer of protection while allowing for aesthetic customisation.

Powder coating: this technique involves applying a dry powder to the steel surface and then curing it under heat to form a hard, protective layer. Powder coating is highly durable and resistant to chipping, scratching, and fading, making it ideal for steel structures exposed to harsh environmental conditions.

3. Regular maintenance and inspection

Regularly maintaining and inspecting steel structures are crucial for early corrosion detection and prompt intervention. Implementing a proactive maintenance programme can help extend the lifespan of steel structures:

Routine inspections: regularly check for signs of corrosion, such as rust spots, discolouration, or blistering paint. Early detection allows for timely repairs and prevents further deterioration.

Cleaning and surface preparation: keeping steel surfaces clean and free of dirt, debris, and contaminants can reduce the risk of corrosion. Regularly washing steel structures, particularly in areas prone to salt or chemical exposure, can help prevent corrosive elements from settling on the surface.

Touch-up coatings: if you notice any areas where the protective coating has worn off or been damaged, apply touch-up coatings promptly to restore protection. This can prevent moisture and corrosive agents from penetrating the steel.

4. Material selection and design considerations

Beyond coatings and treatments, material selection and design play a vital role in preventing corrosion. Consider the following strategies when designing steel structures:

Use of corrosion-resistant alloys: consider using corrosion-resistant alloys such as

stainless steel

or weathering steel in highly corrosive environments. These materials have been specially formulated to resist corrosion without additional coatings.

Drainage design: ensure that the steel structure's design allows for proper water and other liquid drainage. Trapped moisture can accelerate corrosion, so designing with sloped surfaces and adequate drainage systems can help mitigate this risk.

Avoiding dissimilar metals: galvanic corrosion can occur when different metals are used together. This type of corrosion happens when two dissimilar metals come into contact in an electrolyte, such as water. To prevent this, avoid using dissimilar metals or insulating materials to separate them.

Conclusion

Preventing corrosion in steel structures requires a combination of careful material selection, protective coatings, regular maintenance, and thoughtful design. By choosing materials like hot-rolled steel, PPGL, galvalume, and

GP steel

and applying the appropriate treatments, MSMEs can significantly reduce the risk of corrosion and ensure the longevity of their structures. Understanding the importance of corrosion prevention and investing in proper protection techniques will help maintain the integrity and performance of steel structures, ultimately leading to cost savings and enhanced durability over time. Regularly monitoring steel prices, including hot-rolled coil, sheet metal, and steel plate prices, can also help MSMEs make informed decisions and optimise their material investments."

hydration process of cement

is a chemical reaction between cement and water that leads to the material's hardening. This process forms calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and calcium hydroxide, crucial for strength and durability. The hydration process is critical because it governs both the hardening (setting) and the long-term strength development of concrete.  

Enhance your construction process by understanding hydration.

for access to premium cement solutions.

Key steps in the hydration process:

Initial Reaction: when water is added to cement, compounds like tricalcium silicate (C3S) and dicalcium silicate (C2S) react, releasing heat. This is known as an exothermic reaction. C3S contributes to early strength gain, while C2S enhances long-term strength. Calcium ions, hydroxide ions, and other compounds are formed, and the cement paste hardens within a few hours.

Formation of C-S-H gel: As hydration continues, calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) is formed, which gives cement its strength. This process can take days to months and contributes to the gradual development of concrete strength.

Formation of calcium hydroxide: while calcium hydroxide does not directly increase strength, it helps

cement bond

to other materials, creating a solid structure.

The role of cement-treated materials in strength development:

Cement-treated materials, a mixture of soil, granular material, recycled aggregate, cement, and water, play a significant role in enhancing the strength and durability of structures. Commonly used in road bases, backfills, and subgrades, these materials gain strength through hydration. Water reacts with the cement during this process to form a solid skeleton. In contrast, water content and pore structure evolution affect the material's mechanical properties. As hydration progresses, pores in the material are refined, increasing the overall strength of the cement-treated materials.

Importance for strength development:

Compressive strength: the C-S-H formed during hydration is the primary factor in developing compressive strength. As more C-S-H forms, the material hardens, leading to increased strength.

Durability: the hydration process refines the pore structure, making the concrete less porous and more resistant to cracking, which enhances durability. In cement-treated materials, hydration strengthens the structure, allowing them to be used in challenging environments. In India’s diverse environments, from humid coastal areas to arid regions, the hydration process plays a critical role in enhancing durability by reducing porosity and improving resistance to environmental stresses such as freeze-thaw cycles, chemical attacks and water ingress.

Temperature control: as hydration generates heat, controlling the temperature during curing is essential to prevent cracking and ensure even strength distribution, especially in large-scale projects.

Cement hydration is a complex process involving several chemical reactions. The key compounds in

Portland Cement

(C3S, C2S, C3A, and C4AF) interact during hydration, forming calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) essential for strength. Hydration involves the dissolution of clinker particles and the precipitation of hydration products. These reactions create a solid structure that enhances cement's mechanical properties. Despite ongoing research, controlling the precise structure and behaviour of C-S-H remains challenging due to its multiscale properties and the complexity of the hydration process.

At

JSW One MSME

, we provide a wide range of cement products for the diverse needs of Indian MSMEs. Understanding the hydration process is key to achieving the desired strength and longevity of construction materials, ensuring that your projects stand the test of time. By optimising hydration, MSMEs can improve the performance of their cement-treated materials and create durable, high-quality structures."

Thermo-Mechanically Treated (TMT) bars

plays a critical role in achieving high tensile strength and ductility, making them ideal for reinforced concrete structures. The unique combination of a martensitic outer layer and a ferritic-pearlitic core enhances the mechanical properties of the steel. Here's how the microstructure improves these qualities: Martensitic outer layer: This layer forms during the rapid quenching process, giving the

TMT bars

exceptional hardness and tensile strength. Martensite is a hard and brittle structure, and in TMT bars, it is tempered to balance the extreme hardness, making the bars both strong and tough. Ferritic-pearlitic core: The core cools more slowly and consists of ferrite and pearlite. Ferrite provides ductility, while pearlite offers a balance of strength and toughness. This combination ensures that the TMT bars have flexibility, allowing them to bend without breaking, a vital property for withstanding seismic activities or heavy loads.

Corrosion testing and performance evaluation

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and polarisation curves are essential techniques for evaluating the corrosion resistance of TMT bars.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS):

EIS is a non-destructive technique that measures how much a material resists corrosion when exposed to an electric current. TMT bars provide insights into how the martensitic outer layer and ferritic core respond to corrosive attacks. EIS data is presented as a spectrum, showing how the impedance (or resistance) changes at different frequencies. It's particularly useful for detecting early signs of corrosion, even before visible damage occurs. It can also evaluate the effectiveness of protective measures like coatings and inhibitors.

Polarisation curves:

On the other hand, polarisation curves help quantify the corrosion rate by plotting the relationship between the applied voltage and the resulting current density in the steel. For TMT bars, this method identifies critical points such as the breakdown potential—when the protective passive layer on the steel starts to fail, leading to corrosion. It also reveals the repassivation potential, which indicates the steel's ability to restore its protective layer after corrosion starts.  To further enhance the corrosion resistance of TMT bars, several preventive measures can be adopted, including:

Use of corrosion-resistant coatings: protective coatings, such as epoxy or galvanisation, can significantly reduce the

corrosion rate in TMT bars.

These coatings act as a barrier between the steel and the surrounding environment, preventing the ingress of moisture and chlorides.

Cathodic protection: cathodic protection systems use sacrificial anodes or impressed currents to prevent the corrosion of TMT bars. This method is particularly effective in coastal areas with high chloride-induced corrosion risk.

Corrosion inhibitors: adding corrosion inhibitors to the concrete mix can help reduce the rate of corrosion in reinforced structures. These chemicals slow down the electrochemical reactions that lead to the formation of rust on the steel surface.

Improving concrete quality: the quality of the concrete plays a crucial role in

protecting TMT bars from corrosion

. Using a low water-cement ratio and ensuring proper curing can reduce the concrete's permeability, limiting the steel bars' exposure to moisture and corrosive agents.

Importance of microstructure in performance

Microstructural analysis helps ensure that TMT bars meet the required tensile strength and ductility standards. It also highlights how the size, distribution, and proportion of martensite, ferrite, and pearlite influence performance. For instance, the bar might become overly brittle if the martensitic layer is too thick. Conversely, the bar may lose strength if the core contains too much pearlite. Moreover, the fine microstructure of ferrite-pearlite and the absence of any coarse carbide reduces the corrosion rate. This controlled microstructural composition is why TMT bars outperform traditional hot-rolled bars in mechanical tests and real-world applications, making them the

preferred choice for MSMEs

in the construction industry."

These businesses often face significant challenges like delayed customer payments, high operational costs, and limited access to financing. The situation becomes even more complex for traders and distributors

buying steel, cement, or TMT online

. Steel is a high-value material; purchasing it in bulk requires substantial upfront capital. This makes cash flow management even more important, as a single delay in payment can disrupt the entire operation. Our blog will explore simple strategies to help you with cash flow management.

Understand your cash flow

Cash flow is the movement of money in and out of your business. Positive cash flow means you have more money coming in than going out, while negative cash flow is the opposite. As an MSME, understanding your cash flow allows you to make better decisions about when to buy stock, pay suppliers, or reinvest in your business.

Create a cash flow forecast.

A cash flow forecast helps you predict how much money you will have over the coming weeks or months. This is especially helpful when you're buying large quantities of steel. By planning, you can see if there will be shortfalls and act before they become a problem. A simple spreadsheet can work wonders—list your expected income and expenses and track them regularly.

Maintain a healthy balance between income and expenses

Ensure that your income (money from sales) is enough to cover your expenses (payments for stock, rent, salaries, etc.). Sometimes, you may need to adjust your spending to avoid cash shortages. For example, buying stock in smaller quantities during slower periods can help you maintain balance.

Offer flexible payment terms to your buyers

Allowing your customers to pay in instalments or offering a small discount for early payments can encourage faster payment and improve your cash flow. This strategy ensures you have money coming in regularly, which helps in meeting your business obligations on time.

Use credit services to manage cash flow.

Credit services are a great way to bridge the gap between receiving and making payments. Many online platforms, including JSW One MSME, offer credit options to buy manufacturing and construction materials on credit and pay later. This gives you more room to sell your stock, receive customer payments, and then pay your supplier. Keeping your operations running smoothly without worrying about immediate cash flow problems is smart.

JSW One MSME

provides cash flow-based lending solutions to help MSMEs manage their capital more efficiently. These credit options allow you to buy steel and other construction materials online and use flexible payment terms. This supports your cash flow and enables you to focus on growing your business without the stress of immediate payments.

Monitor late payments

Keep an eye on late payments from your customers. Delays in payments can disrupt your cash flow. Set up a clear payment schedule and follow up with customers who fall behind. Automated reminders can save you time and ensure you get paid on time.

Control your stock

Maintaining the right level of stock is important. Too much stock means your money is tied up in unsold products, while too little stock may cause delays in fulfilling orders. Striking the right balance will help you manage your cash flow better.

Keep a cash reserve.

Set aside a small portion of your profits as a cash reserve. This will help you cover unexpected expenses or any gaps in cash flow without taking on debt or selling assets quickly. Even a small reserve can make a big difference in tough times.

Final word

Without a clear strategy, cash flow issues can quickly spiral out of control, jeopardising business stability. The solution lies in proactive cash flow management. By adopting strategies like forecasting, maintaining a balance between income and expenses, using credit services such as JSW One MSME's cash flow-based lending, and keeping a cash reserve, MSMEs can build a financial cushion. These approaches provide breathing room during tight financial periods and allow businesses to grow confidently, ensuring that operational challenges don't derail long-term success."
6J6TJVnLzwvwb8esVPnJTQ,How to optimise energy efficiency in industrial buildings with steel?,How to Optimise Energy Efficiency in Industrial Buildings With Steel? | JSW One MSME Blog,"Learn about advanced strategies like reflective roofing, insulated panels, and efficient HVAC systems that can reduce energy costs and enhance sustainability.",Business,3 minutes,how-to-optimise-energy-efficiency-in-industrial-buildings-with-steel,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"In the rapidly evolving industrial landscape, energy efficiency has become a critical focus for MSMEs in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. With rising energy costs and stringent environmental regulations, optimising energy use in industrial buildings is more pressing than ever. With its strength, versatility, and recyclability, steel plays a significant role in achieving these energy efficiency goals. This blog explores how MSME owners can leverage steel to enhance energy efficiency in their industrial buildings, focusing on technical aspects relevant to their operations.

1. Structural integrity and thermal efficiency

Steel offers exceptional structural integrity, vital for designing and constructing large industrial buildings. Its high strength-to-weight ratio enables the creation of expansive spaces with minimal support columns, which not only maximises usable floor space but also optimises the distribution of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This efficient layout reduces energy consumption by ensuring more effective airflow and temperature control.

In addition, steel structures can be designed with thermal breaks—insulating materials that minimise thermal conductivity between the interior and exterior of the building. These thermal breaks help maintain stable internal temperatures, reducing the need for excessive heating or cooling. By limiting thermal bridging, steel constructions contribute to lower energy usage and cost savings over the building's lifespan.

2. Energy-efficient design strategies

Designing with energy efficiency in mind starts at the conceptual stage. Steel's inherent properties allow for innovative design solutions that enhance energy efficiency. For example, including large windows and skylights in steel buildings increases natural light penetration, reducing the reliance on artificial lighting during daylight hours. This is particularly beneficial in industrial settings where lighting represents significant energy consumption.

Furthermore, insulated metal panels (IMPs) are a key component in energy-efficient steel buildings. These panels consist of two steel sheets surrounding an insulating core, providing superior thermal performance compared to traditional insulation methods. IMPs help reduce heat loss and maintain consistent internal temperatures, significantly contributing to the building's energy efficiency.

3. Sustainable construction and recyclability

Steel is one of the most sustainable materials available because of its recyclability. The steel recycling process is energy-efficient, and using recycled steel in construction reduces the demand for virgin materials, thus lowering the energy required for production. This makes steel a prime choice for MSMEs looking to minimise their environmental impact while enhancing energy efficiency.

Also, recycled steel production consumes much less energy than new steel from raw materials. This reduction in energy use translates to a lower carbon footprint for the building. By opting for recycled steel, industrial builders can align their energy efficiency goals with broader sustainability objectives, which is increasingly important in the current regulatory and market environment.

4. Enhanced insulation and weather resistance

Industrial buildings must often withstand extreme weather conditions, affecting their energy efficiency. When properly designed, steel structures offer excellent resistance to such conditions while maintaining energy performance. For instance,

weather-resistant steels

can reduce the need for frequent maintenance and additional protective coatings, saving energy and resources over the building's operational life.

Advanced insulation techniques, such as insulated metal panels and reflective steel roofing, further enhance the energy efficiency of industrial buildings. These methods provide better thermal performance and contribute to reducing the urban heat island effect, which is particularly beneficial in densely built environments. By incorporating these materials and techniques, MSMEs can significantly reduce their heating and cooling costs.

5. Energy management and monitoring systems

Optimising energy efficiency extends beyond the physical design of the building to include effective energy management. Modern steel buildings can integrate advanced energy management systems that monitor and control energy use in real time. These systems can be connected to HVAC systems, lighting, and industrial machinery, enabling precise control over energy consumption.

For example, energy management systems can automatically adjust the operation of HVAC systems based on real-time occupancy data, reducing unnecessary energy use. Similarly, these systems can optimise lighting by adjusting brightness levels according to natural light availability. By continuously monitoring and adjusting energy use, these systems can help MSMEs significantly reduce energy consumption and costs.

6. Optimising HVAC systems

HVAC systems are often the largest energy consumers in industrial buildings. Steel structures can be designed to enhance the efficiency of these systems by integrating ductwork into the building's framework, thereby reducing energy losses associated with exposed ducts. This integration improves the performance of the HVAC systems and contributes to the building's overall aesthetic and functional efficiency.

Moreover, steel buildings can support installing high-efficiency HVAC systems, which use less energy to maintain desired indoor conditions. These systems can be paired with energy recovery ventilators (ERVs) that capture and reuse energy from exhaust air, further enhancing the building's energy efficiency. For MSMEs, this means lower operational costs and a reduced environmental impact.

7. Reflective roofing and cool roof technology

The roof is a critical component in the energy efficiency of any industrial building. Steel roofing can be designed with reflective coatings or cool roof technology to reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat than conventional roofing materials. This reduction in heat absorption leads to lower cooling requirements, particularly in hot climates, thus reducing energy consumption.

Cool roof technology can also be integrated with green roofs, which provide additional insulation and help mitigate the heat island effect. These combined solutions make

steel roofing

a powerful tool for enhancing energy efficiency in industrial buildings, offering immediate and long-term energy savings and sustainability benefits.

8. Lifecycle cost analysis

When evaluating the energy efficiency of industrial buildings, it is essential to consider not just the initial construction costs but also the building's lifecycle costs.

Steel buildings

, sometimes associated with higher upfront costs, typically have lower lifecycle costs due to their durability, low maintenance requirements, and superior energy efficiency.

Lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA) is an effective method for assessing the long-term economic benefits of steel construction. By considering factors such as energy savings, reduced maintenance costs, and the potential for material recycling, LCCA provides MSME owners with a comprehensive understanding of the financial and environmental advantages of using steel in their industrial buildings.

9. Real-world applications and case studies

Numerous case studies highlight the success of steel in optimising energy efficiency in industrial buildings. For example, modern factories and warehouses frequently use steel construction to achieve large, open spaces supporting heavy machinery while maintaining energy efficiency. These buildings often incorporate insulated metal panels, reflective roofing, and advanced HVAC systems, resulting in substantial energy savings.

These real-world applications demonstrate steel's versatility and effectiveness in meeting industrial building energy efficiency goals. By adopting these practices, MSMEs can enhance operational efficiency, reduce energy costs, and contribute to a more sustainable industrial sector."

The choice of materials plays a vital role in determining the safety and durability of structures under seismic stress. Among the various construction materials available, steel stands out for its unique properties, making it particularly well-suited for seismic-resistant industrial construction. Here are the key advantages of using steel in such applications:

1. High strength-to-weight ratio

One of steel's primary advantages is its high strength-to-weight ratio. This means that steel provides significant strength without adding excessive weight to the structure. This property is crucial in seismic-resistant construction because it allows the building to withstand the forces generated by an earthquake without being overly heavy, which can increase the seismic loads on the structure.

2. Ductility and flexibility

Steel is inherently ductile, meaning it can undergo significant deformation before failure. This ductility allows steel structures to absorb and dissipate energy during an earthquake, reducing the risk of catastrophic collapse. The flexibility of steel also enables it to bend rather than break, which is a critical characteristic for buildings in seismic zones. This flexibility helps steel structures adapt to shifting ground movements during an earthquake, enhancing their resilience.

3. Ease of connection and modification

In industrial construction, connecting and modifying structural components efficiently is essential. Steel offers a high degree of adaptability due to its ease of connection through welding, bolting, or riveting. This versatility allows engineers to design structures that can accommodate changes in design or retrofitting, which is often necessary in seismic-resistant construction to meet updated safety standards. Additionally,

steel structures

can be quickly modified or repaired after an earthquake, minimising downtime and reducing costs.

4. Speed of construction

Another significant advantage of using steel in seismic-resistant industrial projects is the speed of construction. Steel components are typically prefabricated off-site, allowing for rapid assembly on-site. This efficiency not only reduces construction time but also minimises the building project's exposure to potential seismic events during construction. Faster construction timelines also translate to cost savings, a crucial consideration in large-scale industrial projects.

5. Consistency in quality and performance

Steel is produced under controlled conditions, ensuring high consistency in its quality and performance. This uniformity is particularly important in seismic-resistant construction, where any variation in material properties can compromise the structure's safety. Steel's reliability as a construction material means that engineers can predict its behaviour under seismic loads with greater accuracy, leading to safer and more effective structural designs.

6. Resistance to corrosion and fire

In addition to its seismic-resistant properties, steel offers excellent resistance to corrosion and fire when appropriately treated. In industrial environments where exposure to harsh conditions is common, steel's durability ensures that the structure remains safe and functional for an extended period. Fire resistance is also critical in seismic-resistant construction, as fires often follow earthquakes. When equipped with fire-resistant coatings,

steel structures

can provide the necessary protection to prevent the building's collapse in a fire.

7. Sustainability and recyclability

Sustainability is an increasingly important consideration in modern construction. Steel is a highly recyclable material, with a significant proportion of new steel made from recycled scrap. This recyclability reduces the environmental influence of steel production and contributes to the overall sustainability of the construction industry. Moreover, steel structures can be dismantled and reused, further extending the lifecycle of the material and reducing waste.

Conclusion

The use of steel in seismic-resistant industrial construction offers numerous advantages, from its high strength-to-weight ratio and ductility to its ease of construction and modification. These properties make steel an ideal material for creating structures that can withstand the forces of an earthquake while ensuring the safety and durability of the building. As industrial construction continues to evolve, the role of steel in enhancing seismic resistance will remain crucial, providing engineers and builders with a reliable and sustainable option for safeguarding lives and investments."
59EHDNigspEFVFYtNWdX1w,Cash flow challenges faced by OEMs,Cash Flow Challenges Faced by OEMs | JSW One MSME Blog,"Explore strategies like trade credit, supply chain financing, and leveraging off-balance-sheet solutions to keep business operations running smoothly while managing financial pressures.",Business,3 minutes,cash-flow-challenges-faced-by-oems,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) face several challenges when managing their cash. These problems can make it harder to keep their business running smoothly.

A clear understanding of cash flow involves monitoring:

Cash inflows: revenue from sales, client payments, and financial inflows from other sources like loans or investments.

Cash outflows: payments for raw materials, labour, machinery, and operational expenses.

Let's break down some of the common challenges faced by OEMs:

Late payments from customers: OEMs often sell their products to customers who take a long time to pay, sometimes weeks or months after receiving the goods. This delay extends their sell cycles, creating a gap where the company has spent money but hasn’t received any return. Without clear agreements on buying transactions and payment terms. As a result, OEMs must look into trade credit with partners, using unsecured working capital from financial institutions to manage this period effectively.

High upfront costs: OEMs must spend a lot of money at the start of production, buying materials, paying workers, and keeping machines running. They need to pay for these things before their customers pay them, which puts pressure on their available cash. For some, the solution is leveraging off-balance-sheet financing, 30-day credit options, to manage seasonal demand and maintain a steady cash flow.

Managing stock: OEMs need to keep many materials and finished products in stock to meet customer demands, which requires a lot of cash. If demand is slow or delayed, this money is tied up in unsold goods, making it hard to use for other needs. In these cases, exploring trade Accounts Receivable (AR) can free up cash tied to inventory.

Pressure from suppliers: suppliers often require quick payments, but if the OEM hasn’t been paid by its customers yet, it creates a cash flow problem. This pressure can be relieved by negotiating better payment terms or using supply chain financing to bridge the gap, allowing OEMs to manage payments more effectively.

Changes in demand: OEMs must deal with sudden changes in their product needed. When demand goes up, they need to spend more money quickly. When demand drops, they might be left with extra stock that isn't selling, reducing their cash flow.

Currency changes: OEMs that buy or sell internationally face the risk of currency values changing. If the value of a currency goes up or down, it can make supplies more expensive or lower the amount of money they earn from sales in other countries.

Investment in new technology: OEMs often need to spend money on new machines and technology to stay competitive. While this is important for the future, it can be expensive and may not bring profits immediately.

Case Study: cash flow challenges at TechGear Ltd

Background:

TechGear Ltd is a company that makes parts for the automotive industry. Recently, they signed a ₹12 crore contract with a global car manufacturer. The contract lasted six months, but the client agreed to pay TechGear Ltd after 90 days. This was a great opportunity, but it caused some cash flow problems.

Problem 1: rising material costs

During production, the price of steel—one of TechGear Ltd's key materials—increased by 15%. This meant an additional ₹60 lakh in unexpected costs. Since the contract price was fixed, TechGear Ltd had to absorb these extra costs, further tightening its cash flow.

Problem 2: investment in innovation

TechGear Ltd invested ₹1.5 crore in new technology and equipment to improve production efficiency to stay competitive. Although this was important for the future, it strained their cash reserves, as the investment did not bring immediate returns.

Solution: to tackle these cash flow issues, TechGear Ltd took several steps:

Taking a short-term loan: TechGear Ltd took out a ₹2 crore short-term loan to cover the gap between expenses and incoming payments. This allowed the company to continue production without running out of money.

Planning for the future: the company began exploring supply chain financing options to help them receive payments earlier by working with financial institutions. This would make it easier to manage cash flow in future contracts.

Key takeaway: TechGear Ltd's experience shows how important it is for companies to manage their cash flow carefully. Even with a growing business, OEMs must balance spending and income, negotiate better terms with suppliers, and plan for unexpected costs."

Discover how MSMEs can optimise material selection to enhance durability in industrial construction.",Business,3 minutes,how-to-incorporate-steel-cladding-in-industrial-buildings-for-aesthetic,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Steel cladding is crucial in industrial construction, offering protection and durability and contributing significantly to the building's aesthetic appeal. By selecting the right materials—such as hot-rolled steel,

Pre-Painted Galvalume Steel (PPGL)

,

Galvalume steel (GL)

, and Galvanised steel (GP)—industrial structures can achieve a modern, visually appealing look while maintaining functionality and performance. Here’s how MSMEs can leverage these materials' technical properties to enhance their industrial buildings' aesthetics.

1. Selecting the appropriate material

The steel material choice for cladding should consider structural requirements, environmental conditions, and desired aesthetic outcomes. Here’s a closer look at the technical properties of each material:

Hot-rolled steel: this material is formed at high temperatures, which makes it more malleable and easier to work with for large-scale industrial applications. Its blue-grey finish and slightly rough texture lend buildings a raw, industrial aesthetic. The strength of hot-rolled steel makes it suitable for cladding applications that require substantial load-bearing capacity and resistance to impact.

PPGL: PPGL is coated with a layer of zinc for corrosion resistance and then painted for additional protection and aesthetic purposes. The paint layer can be customised in various colours and finishes, allowing creative design options that enhance visual appeal. The combination of zinc coating and paint provides a dual layer of protection against corrosion, making PPGL ideal for industrial buildings exposed to harsh weather conditions.

GL: galvalume steel is coated with an alloy of aluminium and zinc, offering superior corrosion resistance compared to traditional

galvanised steel

. The aluminium in the coating enhances the material's ability to withstand oxidation and rust, especially in environments with high humidity or salinity, such as coastal areas. The smooth, reflective surface of galvalume steel gives a modern, clean look, making it suitable for contemporary industrial designs.

GP: GP steel is coated with a zinc layer to protect against corrosion, like PPGL, but without the extra paint layer. This material is cost-effective and provides a sleek, metallic appearance that is versatile for various industrial building designs. The zinc coating's sacrificial nature allows GP steel to offer long-lasting protection in moderate environmental conditions.

2. Designing with versatility

Steel cladding allows various design possibilities, enabling MSMEs to customise their buildings to meet specific functional and aesthetic needs. Consider the following technical design options:

Panel orientation: the orientation of steel cladding panels—vertical, horizontal, or diagonal—can significantly impact the building's aesthetic and structural performance. Vertical panels can create a sense of height and modernity, while horizontal panels offer a more grounded, stable look. Diagonal panels can add dynamic visual interest and can also influence the structural load distribution on the cladding.

Material combinations: combining different types of steel cladding, such as PPGL with galvalume, can achieve unique visual effects and enhance the building's durability. For instance, using galvalume steel on the building’s upper sections can protect against rain and sun exposure, while PPGL can add colour and visual interest to lower sections.

Textural finishes: steel cladding is available in various textures, from smooth and glossy to matte and embossed. Choosing the right texture can complement the building’s overall architectural style and enhance its aesthetic appeal. Textured finishes can also help diffuse light and reduce glare, which can be particularly beneficial in bright, sunny environments.

3. Maximising cost-efficiency and performance

Balancing aesthetics with cost-efficiency is crucial for MSMEs. Here are some technical considerations to optimise both:

Material thickness: the appropriate thickness for steel cladding is vital for performance and cost efficiency. Thicker steel sheets provide greater strength and durability but come at a higher cost. For non-structural applications, thinner sheets may be sufficient and more economical.

Surface coatings: advanced coatings such as Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) or Silicon-Modified Polyester (SMP) can significantly extend the lifespan of steel cladding by enhancing its resistance to UV radiation and chemical exposure. These coatings are particularly beneficial in environments with high pollution levels or extreme weather conditions.

Market analysis: staying updated on steel prices, including hot-rolled coil prices, galvanised sheet rates, and steel plate costs, can help MSMEs make informed purchasing decisions. Buying in bulk or during market downturns can result in substantial savings.

4. Enhancing sustainability and energy efficiency

Incorporating sustainable practices into

steel cladding

design reduces environmental impact and can enhance the building's energy efficiency. Here’s how:

Reflective coatings: using reflective coatings on steel cladding can improve the building's energy efficiency by reducing heat absorption and cooling costs. This is particularly useful in hot climates where reducing the building's thermal load is a priority.

Recyclable materials: steel is inherently recyclable, making it an excellent choice for environmentally conscious construction. Designing with recyclable steel materials ensures that they can be repurposed at the end of their life cycle, contributing to a circular economy.

Insulated panels: integrating insulated steel cladding panels can improve the thermal performance of the building envelope. These panels consist of a core insulation material sandwiched between two steel layers, offering superior thermal resistance and helping to maintain a stable indoor climate.

Conclusion

The building envelope significantly influences the internal temperature by acting as a thermal barrier between the interior and exterior environments. Modern cladding systems can reduce heat transfer and minimise reliance on HVAC systems, leading to substantial energy savings over time."

In the case of

TMT bars

, which are used in reinforced concrete structures, this phenomenon occurs when the bars are exposed to repetitive loading and environmental elements like moisture, salt, and chemicals, leading to premature failure. Unlike typical fatigue, where materials degrade in dry or inert environments, corrosion fatigue involves the influence of environmental factors like humidity or saltwater, which accelerate crack growth. 

The repetitive loading causes micro-cracks in the bars, and when combined with exposure to corrosive agents, these cracks propagate more quickly, weakening the steel. Over time, this degradation reduces the load-bearing capacity of the bars, leading to the potential collapse of the structure if not properly managed.

Causes of corrosion fatigue in TMT bars

Several factors contribute to corrosion fatigue in TMT bars, especially in India's diverse climatic conditions: 

Environmental exposure 

The most common cause of corrosion fatigue is exposure to a corrosive environment. Structures near coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to high salt content in the air, which accelerates the corrosion of TMT bars. Additionally, areas with high humidity or industrial pollution are prone to creating corrosive environments, weakening the bars over time.

Moisture ingress 

Moisture entering the concrete structure through cracks or poor-quality concrete mix can accelerate the corrosion process. Water and oxygen reaching the TMT bars initiate the rusting process, leading to the weakening of the steel’s protective oxide layer. Over time, the cyclic stress from load-bearing in the presence of this rust formation increases the risk of fatigue. 

Cyclic loading 

Structures that undergo repetitive loading cycles, such as bridges, highways, and industrial buildings, are more prone to fatigue. The combination of constant stress and corrosion accelerates crack growth in TMT bars, weakening the steel and reducing its ability to support the loads it was designed for. 

Chloride attack 

Chloride ions, which are abundant in coastal areas or regions where de-icing salts are used, penetrate concrete and initiate

corrosion in TMT

bars. Chlorides break down the passive oxide layer on steel, leading to accelerated corrosion and fatigue when combined with mechanical stress.

Poor concrete quality 

The quality of the concrete mix used in construction significantly impacts the performance of TMT bars. Poor-quality concrete with high porosity allows more moisture and corrosive agents to penetrate, accelerating the corrosion process. Additionally, improper curing and placement techniques can leave gaps in the concrete, exposing TMT bars to the elements. 

Micro-cracking during the manufacturing process 

If TMT bars have pre-existing micro-cracks formed during the manufacturing or quenching process, these cracks can act as stress concentrators. When exposed to corrosive environments, these cracks expand under cyclic loading, leading to premature fatigue failure.

Prevention methods for corrosion fatigue

To prevent corrosion fatigue in TMT bars, several measures can be implemented during both the design and construction phases. Below are some of the most effective strategies for reducing the risk of corrosion fatigue in reinforced concrete structures: 

Using corrosion-resistant TMT bars 

One of the most effective ways to mitigate corrosion fatigue is by using

corrosion-resistant TMT bars

, such as those with epoxy coatings or galvanised TMT bars or steels containing corrosion resistant alloying elements such as Cr, Mo, Ni and Cu in correct proportions. These coatings provide a protective barrier that prevents moisture and corrosive agents from reaching the steel surface. Alloying elements like Cr can form a protective oxide layer on the surface whereas elements like Mo, Cu or Ni act as corrosion inhibitors. In addition, newer technologies like the application of corrosion inhibitors directly to the steel surface during manufacturing can significantly reduce corrosion risk. 

Improving concrete quality 

High-quality concrete is essential for protecting TMT bars from environmental elements. Using a low water-cement ratio and adding supplementary cementitious materials like fly ash or silica fume can reduce the permeability of the concrete, thereby limiting the ingress of water, chlorides, and other harmful substances. Proper curing techniques and the use of high-quality aggregates further contribute to the durability of the concrete, enhancing the protection of TMT bars."

Safety and reliability

Steel’s structural integrity under various stress conditions is critical to ensuring the safety and reliability of industrial storage systems. The material's inherent strength minimises the risk of structural failure, reducing the potential for accidents such as rack collapses. Moreover, steel production for industrial racking adheres to stringent national and international standards, ensuring consistent quality and safety across different installations.

Low maintenance and cost-effectiveness

One key advantage of using steel in industrial storage systems is its low maintenance requirement.

Galvanised steel

, in particular, offers a maintenance-free service life due to its resistance to corrosion and mechanical wear. This results in significant cost savings over the storage system's lifespan, as it reduces the need for frequent repairs or replacements. Steel's long service life also provides a high return on investment, making it a cost-effective choice for industrial applications.

However, they are often subjected to harsh environmental conditions that can lead to corrosion and degradation over time. Applying the appropriate coatings is crucial to mitigate these effects and enhance the durability of

steel fasteners

. This blog provides a technical overview of how

steel coatings

improve fastener longevity and offers detailed guidance on selecting and using the most effective coatings.

Understanding the importance of coatings for steel fasteners

Despite its strength, steel is inherently susceptible to corrosion, especially when exposed to moisture, salts, chemicals, and other corrosive agents. Corrosion can significantly compromise the mechanical properties of fasteners, leading to failures that might endanger structural integrity. Coatings act as a protective barrier, shielding the steel substrate from corrosive elements, thereby prolonging the service life of the fasteners.

Types of coatings for enhanced durability

Different coatings provide varying levels of protection depending on their chemical composition and application process. Here are some of the most used coatings for steel fasteners, along with their technical attributes: 

Zinc coating (galvanisation): 

Hot-dip galvanising: this process involves immersing steel fasteners into molten zinc at approximately 450°c. The zinc reacts with the steel to form a series of zinc-iron alloy layers topped with pure zinc, creating a thick, durable coating. Hot-dip galvanising provides cathodic protection, meaning the zinc coating sacrifices itself to protect the underlying steel, making it ideal for outdoor and marine environments where high corrosion resistance is required. 

Electro-galvanising: zinc is deposited onto the steel fastener using an electric current in this electrochemical process. This method produces a thinner, more uniform coating compared to hot-dip galvanising. Electro-galvanised coatings are less corrosion-resistant but offer a smoother surface finish, making them suitable for applications with moderate exposure to corrosive elements. 

Phosphate coating: 

Zinc phosphate: this coating is applied through a chemical reaction between the steel substrate and a zinc-containing phosphoric acid solution. The result is a crystalline layer of zinc phosphate that provides a good base for subsequent painting or lubrication and improves corrosion resistance in moderate environments. 

Manganese phosphate: similar to zinc phosphate but involving manganese, this coating produces a thicker, denser layer that is highly resistant to wear. Manganese phosphate coatings are ideal for high-friction applications requiring additional wear resistance. 

PTFE coating (polytetrafluoroethylene): 

PTFE coatings, known for their low friction and excellent chemical resistance, are applied through spraying and curing. The coating provides a non-reactive barrier that is particularly effective against aggressive chemicals and extreme temperatures. PTFE is suitable for fasteners in chemical processing plants and other corrosive environments. 

Epoxy coating: 

Epoxy coatings are created by mixing epoxy resins with hardening agents and applying them to fasteners. Once cured, the epoxy forms a hard, durable layer that offers excellent moisture, chemicals, and mechanical wear resistance. These coatings are well-suited for industrial applications where high durability and corrosion resistance are paramount. 

Powder coating: 

This dry-finishing process involves applying a thermoplastic or thermoset powder to the fasteners, which is then cured under heat to form a hard, durable finish. Powder coatings provide excellent resistance to chipping, scratching, and fading, making them ideal for functional and aesthetic applications.

Selecting the appropriate coating

Choosing the right coating for steel fasteners requires a thorough understanding of the operational environment and the specific demands of the application. Here are the technical factors to consider: 

Environmental exposure: assess the type and level of exposure the fasteners will face, including humidity, salt, chemicals, and UV radiation. For example, marine environments require robust coatings like hot-dip galvanising due to the high salt content and moisture levels. 

Mechanical stress: consider the mechanical loads and stresses the fasteners will endure. Fasteners subjected to high friction or stress, such as those in automotive or heavy machinery applications, may benefit from harder coatings like manganese phosphate or epoxy. 

Thermal conditions: evaluate the fasteners' temperature range. Coatings like PTFE are suitable for high-temperature applications due to their thermal stability, while zinc coatings are limited by their melting point (around 419°c). 

Chemical resistance: determine the fasteners' chemical exposure. PTFE or epoxy coatings provide superior resistance for environments with frequent contact with corrosive chemicals.

Best practices for applying coatings

The application process significantly influences the performance of a coating. Here are technical guidelines to ensure optimal coating application: 

Surface preparation: 

Proper surface preparation is crucial for coating adhesion and longevity. Techniques such as abrasive blasting, acid pickling, or alkaline cleaning may remove oxides, oils, and contaminants from the steel surface, ensuring a clean substrate for coating.

Coating application: 

The choice of application method depends on the coating type. For instance, hot-dip galvanising involves immersion in molten zinc, while electro-galvanising requires an electroplating setup. Spraying techniques are used for PTFE and powder coatings, requiring careful control of application parameters to achieve uniform coverage. 

Curing process: 

Curing is essential for developing the coating's final properties. For epoxy and powder coatings, this typically involves heating the coated fasteners to a specified temperature to initiate a chemical reaction that forms a durable finish. The curing temperature and time must be precisely controlled to prevent defects such as blistering or incomplete curing. 

Quality assurance: 

Implement rigorous quality control measures to verify coating thickness, adhesion, and uniformity. Non-destructive testing methods, such as ultrasonic thickness gauges or magnetic induction, can be employed to ensure compliance with specifications.

Conclusion

provides enhanced corrosion resistance compared to traditional galvanised steel, making it ideal for roofing and cladding applications.

2. Structural design: engineering for strength and stability

The structural design of an industrial shed must consider factors such as load-bearing capacity, wind and seismic forces, and future scalability. Adhering to local building codes and international standards is critical for ensuring structural safety.

Load-bearing capacity:

Dead loads: calculate the dead load based on the weight of the steel structure, roofing materials, and any permanent equipment or fixtures. HR steel grades E250 and E350 are commonly used for the primary load-bearing structure. 

Live loads: consider dynamic loads, including equipment, inventory, and workforce activity. For heavy-duty applications, opt for higher-grade steels or reinforced structural members.

Wind load and seismic design:

Wind loads: use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis to model wind forces on the shed. Design the structure to resist wind uplift and lateral forces, ensuring that connections and anchor points can transfer these forces to the foundation. 

Seismic forces: in seismic zones, lateral force-resisting systems such as braced or moment-resisting frames are incorporated. Design steel connections to allow ductility and energy dissipation during seismic events.

Modular design for scalability: 

Pre-engineered building systems (PEBs): consider PEBs for modular construction, allowing for easy expansion or reconfiguration. Modular components should be designed for easy assembly and disassembly, facilitating future modifications with minimal disruption.

3. Corrosion protection: enhancing the durability of steel structures

Corrosion is a major concern in steel structures, especially in industrial settings exposed to moisture, chemicals, or extreme weather. Implementing effective corrosion protection strategies is essential for extending the lifespan of the shed.

Protective coatings:

Galvanisation: apply hot-dip galvanisation (HDG) to

structural steel

members for robust protection against corrosion. The thickness of the zinc coating should be selected based on the expected exposure conditions (e.g., iso 1461 standard for HDG). 

Epoxy and polyurethane coatings: for additional protection, especially in aggressive environments, apply epoxy or polyurethane coatings over galvanised steel. These coatings provide a secondary barrier against moisture and chemical exposure.

Cathodic protection:

Consider using cathodic protection systems in environments with severe corrosion risk (e.g., coastal or chemical plants). This technique uses sacrificial anodes or impressed current systems to protect steel components from corrosion.

Maintenance protocols:

Establish a maintenance schedule for regular inspection and re-application of protective coatings. Early detection and treatment of corrosion can prevent structural degradation and costly repairs.

4. Thermal insulation and ventilation: maintaining environmental control

Thermal and environmental control within the shed is crucial for both operational efficiency and the preservation of stored goods. Appropriate insulation and ventilation systems are essential for maintaining optimal internal conditions.

Insulation materials:

Insulated metal panels (IMPS): for effective thermal insulation, use imps with a core of polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foam. These panels offer a high R-values, reducing heat transfer and maintaining a stable internal temperature. 

Reflective insulation: for roofing, consider installing reflective insulation to minimise heat gain. This is particularly beneficial in hot climates, significantly reducing cooling loads.

Ventilation systems:

Natural ventilation: design the shed with strategically placed openings, such as ridge vents, louvred vents, and operable windows, to facilitate natural airflow and prevent heat buildup. 

Mechanical ventilation: in cases where natural ventilation is insufficient, install mechanical ventilation systems, including exhaust fans and air circulators. Ensure that these systems are designed to provide adequate air changes per hour (ach) for the shed’s volume and use case.

5. Prefabrication and modular construction: streamlining the build process

Prefabrication and modular construction methods offer numerous advantages, including reduced construction time, improved quality control, and lower labour costs. Leveraging these methods can enhance the efficiency of industrial shed construction.

Prefabricated steel components:

Precision manufacturing: prefabricated components are manufactured under controlled conditions, ensuring high precision and reducing on-site errors. Use computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems to optimise the design and production of

steel components

. 

Assembly efficiency: prefabricated components are delivered to the site ready for assembly, significantly reducing construction time. Design connections for ease of assembly, using bolted or welded connections as appropriate.

Integrated building systems:

Structural systems: use integrated structural systems where the primary frame, roof, and wall panels are designed as a cohesive unit. This approach ensures compatibility and reduces the need for on-site modifications. 

Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) integration: where possible, pre-integrate MEP systems into the modular components. This reduces installation time and ensures these systems are properly coordinated with the structural elements.

Conclusion

Constructing a durable industrial shed requires meticulous planning, precise engineering, and a deep understanding of the materials and methods involved.

IS 2062 E250A steel

is known for its strength, durability, and corrosion resistance, all essential qualities for materials used in heavy-duty applications like truck bodies. This

hot-rolled steel

grade is commonly used in various industries, including transportation, construction, and manufacturing, where robustness and reliability are crucial.

Challenges faced by steel truck bodies in heavy-duty settings

Corrosion: exposure to harsh weather conditions, road salts, and chemicals can lead to corrosion of

steel truck bodies

over time, especially in regions with high humidity chemical industrial zones or coastal areas. Corrosion weakens the structural integrity of the body, leading to premature failure.

Weight: steel truck bodies are generally heavier than those that have alternative materials like composite materials. This added weight can reduce the truck's payload capacity and increase fuel consumption, especially in heavy-duty settings where maximising payload capacity is crucial.

Impact resistance: while steel is durable, it may dent or deform upon impact with heavy objects or during accidents. Steel truck bodies are susceptible to damage from falling debris, equipment collisions, or rough terrain in heavy-duty settings such as construction sites or off-road environments.

Fatigue: repeated loading and unloading and constant vibrations during transportation can lead to metal fatigue in steel truck bodies over time. This can manifest as cracks, fractures, or weld failures, compromising the body's structural integrity.

Protective coatings and treatments
Advanced coatings and surface treatments: applying corrosion-resistant paints, galvanisation, or powder coating can significantly extend the lifespan of

steel truck

bodies by protecting against corrosion, abrasion, and chemical damage. These coatings improve the body's resilience, particularly in challenging environments with exposure to moisture, salt, or harsh chemicals.

High-strength steel alloys: using high-strength steel alloys with improved mechanical properties allows for the construction of lighter yet stronger truck bodies. These alloys (with small amounts of sulphur, phosphorus, molybdenum, and silicon to carbon and iron) offer excellent resistance to deformation and fatigue, enhancing the overall durability and longevity of the body.

How to enhance payload capacity and efficiency

Maintenance: steel truck bodies require regular maintenance, including painting and rust-proofing, to prevent corrosion and ensure longevity. However, maintenance can be time-consuming and costly, particularly in heavy-duty settings where vehicles are subjected to rigorous use and may not always be easily accessible for maintenance tasks.

Advanced material selection: utilising high-strength steel alloys with superior mechanical properties allows for the construction of lighter yet equally strong truck bodies. These alloys offer higher strength-to-weight ratios than traditional steel, enabling manufacturers to reduce weight without sacrificing structural integrity.

Optimised design: employing advanced computer-aided design (CAD) software and simulation tools enables engineers to optimise the

design of steel truck

bodies for maximum efficiency and structural integrity. By strategically distributing materials and reinforcing critical areas, designers can save weight while maintaining strength where needed.

Sectional optimisation: employing sectional optimisation techniques involves varying the thickness and reinforcement of different sections of the truck body based on anticipated stress levels and load distribution. By tailoring the design to specific load requirements, manufacturers can minimise excess material and reduce overall weight without compromising strength.

Integration of lightweight components: incorporating lightweight components and materials into the construction of steel truck bodies can further reduce weight without sacrificing strength. For example, using aluminium or composite materials for non-structural elements like doors, fenders, or interior panels can yield significant weight savings without compromising overall integrity.

Hollow section design: designing certain structural elements of the truck body as hollow sections can reduce weight while maintaining strength. Manufacturers can achieve substantial weight savings without compromising load-bearing capacity by optimising hollow components' geometry and wall thickness.

Advanced joining techniques: utilising advanced joining methods such as adhesive bonding, riveting, or clinching in addition to welding can reduce the need for heavy reinforcement materials like bolts or weld beads, resulting in lighter overall structures without compromising strength.

By employing these lightweight strategies in the design and

construction of steel trucks

, manufacturers can significantly improve payload capacity while ensuring that vehicles remain robust and capable of withstanding the rigours of heavy-duty operations."

3xMzuMT3joT9RDhJEYBfvV,How to maintain the longevity of steel fasteners in harsh environments?,How to Maintain the Longevity of Steel Fasteners in Harsh Environments | JSW One MSME Blog,"Learn about the best materials, protective coatings, and maintenance practices to ensure the longevity and reliability of your fasteners.",Business,3 minutes,how-to-maintain-the-longevity-of-steel-fasteners-in-harsh-environments,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Over time, extreme conditions such as fluctuating temperatures, high humidity, corrosive chemicals, and heavy loads can wear down even the most robust fasteners, leading to potential failure. The consequences of such failures can be dire, ranging from costly repairs to catastrophic accidents. This makes the longevity of steel fasteners not just a matter of maintenance but a critical component of safety and reliability.  

Understanding how to maintain and extend the life of these fasteners begins with choosing the right materials, applying protective measures, and adhering to proper maintenance practices. Let’s explore some effective strategies to ensure your

steel fasteners

can withstand the test of time, even in the harshest environments.

Understanding the material: carbon steel

Carbon steel is popular for fasteners due to its strength, affordability, and versatility. Specifically, fine grain, fully killed

carbon steel

is often used in harsh environments. This type of steel is completely deoxidised during the manufacturing process, resulting in a more uniform and stable structure. The absence of oxygen reduces the risk of internal defects, making it more resistant to stress and corrosion.

Low-carbon steels, containing between 0.06% and 0.22% carbon, are especially favoured for fasteners that require good flexibility for cold-forming processes. These steels balance strength and flexibility, which is crucial in environments where fasteners may be subjected to fluctuating temperatures and mechanical loads. Medium-carbon steels (e.g., AISI 1038, 1045) contain 0.30% to 0.50% carbon, offering greater strength but reduced ductility. They respond well to quench and temper, making them ideal for applications requiring enhanced toughness. High-carbon steels contain 0.50% or more carbon and, while challenging to cold-form unless annealed, offer high strength and are well-suited for heat treatment.

Alloy steels and their advantages

Alloy steels, such as those alloyed with molybdenum, nickel, and chromium, are excellent choices when strength is a priority. These steels not only offer high strength but also possess good cold-forming properties when annealed. They can be heat-treated to achieve the best combination of strength, toughness, and shock resistance, making them ideal for fasteners exposed to extreme stress and environmental conditions.

Tips for extending the life of steel fasteners  

Choose the right coating

Galvanisation: applying a zinc coating to steel fasteners through galvanisation is one of the most effective ways to protect them from corrosion. The zinc acts as a sacrificial layer, preventing the underlying steel from oxidising.  

Electroplating: for environments where aesthetic considerations are important, electroplating with nickel or chrome can offer both protection and a polished appearance.  

Hot-dip coating: this involves dipping the fastener in molten zinc, creating a thick, durable coating that is ideal for outdoor and marine environments.

Regular maintenance and inspection

Periodic inspections are vital to detect early wear, corrosion, or loosening signs. Inspections should be more frequent in environments with high humidity or chemical exposure.  

Tightening or replacing fasteners as needed can prevent failure and extend their lifespan.

Use of sealants and lubricants

Applying sealants can protect fasteners from moisture ingress, a common cause of corrosion.  

Lubricants reduce friction and wear, particularly in fasteners subjected to high mechanical loads. They also provide a barrier against corrosive agents.

Environmental control

Where possible, controlling the environment to reduce exposure to corrosive elements, such as saltwater or acidic chemicals, can significantly extend the life of steel fasteners.  

Implementing dehumidification or using protective enclosures can minimise the impact of harsh conditions.

Heat treatment

Annealing: This process involves heating the steel fastener to a specific temperature and then slowly cooling it. Annealing softens the metal, relieving internal stresses and improving ductility, making the fastener less prone to cracking under strain.  

Tempering: After hardening, tempering is used to reheat the steel to a lower temperature, which reduces brittleness while maintaining hardness. This process enhances the fastener's toughness, making it more resilient in high-stress environments.

Cathodic protection

Cathodic protection can be employed in highly corrosive environments. This technique involves using a sacrificial anode or an impressed current to divert corrosion from the fastener.

Proper installation techniques

Ensure that fasteners are installed correctly, using the appropriate torque settings to avoid over-tightening or under-tightening, which can lead to premature failure.  

Locking mechanisms, such as lock washers or thread-locking compounds, can prevent loosening in applications involving vibration or movement.

Material selection for harsh environments

Choosing the right material is crucial for fasteners exposed to extreme conditions. For instance, austenitic

stainless steels

offer the best corrosion resistance due to their high nickel and chromium content. While non-magnetic and not heat-treatable, they have excellent cold-forming characteristics, although they are prone to work hardening.  

Martensitic stainless steels can be heat-treated and offer more strength but lower corrosion resistance than austenitic types.  

Precipitation-hardening stainless steels balance high strength and good corrosion resistance, with added benefits of good machinability and weldability.

Use of specialised steels

Resulfurised and phosphorised steels offer better machinability than basic carbon steels, making them ideal for screw-machine parts. These steels are more brittle but stronger and less ductile than basic steels. The addition of sulphur acts as an internal lubricant, while phosphorus makes the steel more brittle but reduces friction, heat, and tool wear.

Conclusion

Steel fasteners' longevity in harsh environments is not just about extending their life; it’s about ensuring the safety and integrity of the structures and machines they hold together. Understanding the material properties, applying appropriate coatings, conducting regular maintenance, and using proper installation techniques can significantly enhance the durability of these critical components."

This ratio is defined as the proportion of the weight of water to the weight of

cement

used in a concrete mix. Understanding how this ratio impacts the properties of concrete is essential for achieving the desired balance between workability and strength in any construction project.

Impact on workability

Workability refers to the ease with which concrete can be mixed, placed, compacted, and finished. The water-cement ratio plays a significant role in determining the workability of concrete:

High water-cement ratio:

Increased workability: a higher

water-cement ratio

results in more fluid concrete, making it easier to work with, especially in complex forms or where detailed finishing is required. 

Reduced viscosity: the mix becomes less viscous, allowing for better flow and easier compaction, which is particularly beneficial in situations where the concrete needs to fill intricate molds or pass through narrow gaps.

Low water-cement ratio:

Decreased workability: a lower water-cement ratio results in a stiffer mix, which can be more challenging to place and compact. This can lead to difficulties in achieving proper consolidation, potentially resulting in voids or honeycombing. 

Higher viscosity: the mix becomes thicker, making it harder to handle and requiring more effort for placement and finishing.

Impact on strength

Strength is one of the most critical characteristics of concrete, and the water-cement ratio significantly influences this property:

High water-cement ratio:

Lower strength: while a

high water-cement ratio

improves workability, it negatively affects the strength of concrete. The excess water creates more capillary pores within the concrete, leading to increased porosity and reduced compressive strength. 

Weaker bonding: the dilution of the cement paste results in weaker bonding between the aggregates, further reducing the overall strength of the concrete.

Low water-cement ratio:

Higher strength: a lower water-cement ratio leads to a denser concrete mix, with fewer capillary pores. This results in higher compressive strength and better durability. 

Improved bonding: the reduced water content allows for a stronger bond between the cement paste and aggregates, enhancing the structural integrity of the concrete.

Balancing workability and strength

Achieving the optimal balance between workability and strength requires careful consideration of the water-cement ratio. In general: 

For high-strength concrete: a lower water-cement ratio is preferred to maximize strength, though this may require the use of chemical admixtures or additional compaction techniques to maintain workability. 

For workable concrete: a higher water-cement ratio may be necessary for ease of placement, particularly in complex forms or where detailed finishing is required, but this will typically reduce the concrete's strength.

Conclusion

The water-cement ratio is a fundamental factor in concrete mix design, directly affecting both the workability and strength of the concrete. Understanding how to manipulate this ratio allows engineers and construction professionals to tailor concrete mixes to meet the specific requirements of their projects, ensuring both ease of use and structural integrity. By carefully balancing the water-cement ratio, it is possible to achieve the desired performance characteristics for any given application."

The hot rolling process involves heating the steel above its recrystallisation temperature, which improves its toughness and resistance to impacts. This makes it ideal for load-bearing applications in PEBs.

Coated steel

: coated steel, such as colour-coated galvanised sheets, offers enhanced corrosion resistance, making it suitable for environments exposed to moisture and chemicals. The galvanisation process involves coating the steel with a layer of zinc, which acts as a barrier against rust. The addition of a colour coat not only improves aesthetics but also adds an extra layer of protection. This makes coated steel an excellent choice for roofing and wall panels in PEBs, ensuring durability over time.

The role of formability in PEB design

Formability refers to a material's ability to easily shape or mould without cracking. In PEBs, formability is crucial, as it determines the ease with which materials can be fabricated into various components, such as beams, columns, and panels.

Hot-rolled steel sections

: hot-rolled steel sections are known for their excellent formability, allowing them to be easily shaped into different profiles, such as I-beams and h-beams. This flexibility is essential for creating the framework of PEBs, enabling architects and engineers to design structures that meet specific load and aesthetic requirements.

Cold-rolled steel sheet

: cold-rolled steel sheets offer excellent formability due to their finer grain structure, resulting from the cold rolling process. These sheets can be easily bent, stamped, or formed into complex shapes, making them ideal for cladding, roofing, and other detailed components of PEBs. The smooth surface finish also provides a perfect coatings base, enhancing durability and appearance.

Coated steel

: the formability of coated steel, particularly colour-coated galvanised sheets, allows for versatile design options. The coating process does not compromise the steel's ability to be shaped, enabling the creation of curved or intricate designs that enhance the architectural appeal of PEBs.

Combining durability and formability for quality PEBs

The interplay between durability and formability is vital for the overall quality of PEBs. While durability ensures the longevity and resilience of the structure, formability allows for creative and efficient design solutions. The choice of materials, such as hot-rolled coil, hot-rolled steel sections, and coated steel, directly impacts these characteristics.

For instance, high-quality hot-rolled steel ensures the structural components have the strength and toughness to withstand various loads and environmental conditions. On the other hand, the use of coated steel, like colour-coated galvanised sheets, adds an extra layer of protection and aesthetic value, enhancing both the durability and visual appeal of the building.

550 TMT bars

contain a balanced mix of carbon, sulphur, phosphorus, and other alloying elements. The carbon content is higher than in lower grades, contributing to increased strength.

Mechanical properties:

Yield strength: 550 MPa minimum 

Ultimate tensile strength (uts): typically 1.08 times the yield strength 

Elongation:  Elongation percentage, typically around 14-16% 

Applications: 550 TMT bars are ideal for infrastructure projects such as bridges, dams, and industrial buildings requiring high strength and load-bearing capacity.

550D TMT bars

Overview: the ‘d’ in 550D TMT bars is ‘ductility’. These bars offer the same yield strength of minimum 550 MPa as standard 550 TMT bars but with improved ductility. The enhanced ductility makes 550D bars more suitable for areas prone to seismic activity or where structures are exposed to dynamic loads. 

Chemical composition: compared to 550 bars, 550D TMT bars have lower carbon content and controlled amounts of sulphur and phosphorus. This composition reduces the steel's brittleness, enhancing its ductility and making it more resistant to stress.

Mechanical properties:

Yield strength: 550 MPa minimum 

Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS): Typically 1.10 times the yield strength 

Elongation: higher elongation percentage, typically around 18-20% 

Applications: 550D TMT bars are particularly suited for projects in earthquake-prone zones, high-rise buildings, and structures requiring high-impact resistance and flexibility.

Key differences between 550 and 550D TMT bars

A crucial aspect of PEBs is the selection of appropriate steel grades and coatings, which significantly influence the structure's quality, durability, and overall performance. This blog explores the impact of steel grades and coatings on PEB structures, focusing on the steel grades E250A, and E250BR and their relevance to critical quality aspects such as table-top flatness, durability, and formability.

Understanding steel grades: E250A, and E250BR

Steel grades

provide essential information about a material's properties, helping engineers select the most suitable type for specific applications. Here's an overview of the steel grades commonly used in PEB structures:

E250A

: this hot-rolled steel grade with a minimum yield strength of 250 MPa. It is known for its good formability and weldability, making it suitable for general structural applications. The lower carbon content in E250A enhances its ductility, allowing it to be easily bent or shaped without cracking.

E350A

: with a minimum yield strength of 350 MPa, E350A offers higher strength compared to E250A. This makes it ideal for structural applications requiring greater load-bearing capacity. However, the increased strength reduces its formability, making it less suitable for complex shapes. E350A is commonly used in building columns, beams, and critical load-bearing components.

E350BR

: this grade shares the same minimum yield strength as E350A (and UTS of 490) but includes additional alloying elements to improve resistance to atmospheric corrosion. E350BR is particularly useful in coastal and industrial environments where structures are exposed to harsh weather conditions.

The role of steel coatings

Steel coatings enhance the material's resistance to corrosion and wear, thus extending the lifespan of PEB structures. The choice of coating depends on the environmental conditions and specific requirements of the project.

Hot rolled coil (HRC) and hot rolled steel sections

: these products are typically used for the main structural elements of PEBs. Hot rolling involves heating the steel above its recrystallisation temperature, which allows for large deformations and results in a uniform microstructure. This process helps achieve the required table-top flatness, which is crucial for the precision alignment of structural components.

Coated steel

is a staple in modern construction, combining the compressive strength of concrete with the tensile strength of steel to create a durable, long-lasting material. However, the question arises: can you over-reinforce concrete? The short answer is yes. Over-reinforcing concrete can lead to several issues that compromise the structural integrity and longevity of a building. In this blog, we'll explore the concept of over-reinforcement, its implications, and how to avoid it using high-quality materials like

JSW cement

and appropriate TMT bars.

Understanding reinforced concrete

Reinforced concrete sections can be constructed with varying percentages of steel reinforcements. The amount of reinforcement used categorises these sections into three types:

Balanced

Under-reinforced

Over-reinforced

The behaviour of these sections' underload depends significantly on the amount of reinforcement.

What happens when you over-reinforce concrete?

Over-reinforced sections in reinforced concrete structures are those where the concrete reaches its failure strain before the steel reinforcement yields. This scenario is problematic for several reasons: 

Sudden failure: in an over-reinforced section, the steel does not yield significantly before the concrete fails. This results in a sudden and brittle failure without the warning signs, such as cracks or deflections that typically precede structural failure. This can be dangerous as it doesn't allow time for evacuation or repairs.

Reduced ductility: over-reinforced concrete lacks the ductility provided by the steel reinforcement. This means the structure can handle less deformation before failing, which is crucial for absorbing energy during earthquakes. 

Honeycombing and cracking: excessive reinforcement can lead to honeycombing, where gaps and voids form in the concrete due to improper filling around the rebar. It can also cause cracking due to the strain on the drying concrete, which fails to accommodate shrinkage. 

Increased costs: using more steel than necessary increases the cost of construction without proportionate benefits in strength or durability. Monitoring cement prices and

JSW cement rates

is crucial to managing costs effectively.

Proper use of reinforcement

It's essential to follow standard codes and guidelines for reinforced concrete construction to avoid over-reinforcement. Here are a few tips:

Correct proportioning: the typical percentage of steel reinforcement in concrete should be between 3% and 5%, depending on the application. This balance ensures the concrete and steel work together effectively.

High-quality materials: using high-quality materials such as JSW cement and TMT bars can enhance the overall performance of the reinforced concrete. JSW cement offers various grades suitable for different construction needs, ensuring durability and strength.

Proper mixing and pouring: ensure the concrete mix has the correct water-cement ratio to prevent shrinkage and honeycombing. Using JSW cement, known for its consistent quality, can help achieve the desired mix.

Weather considerations: during the monsoon, take extra precautions to cover the work site and protect the concrete from excess water. Allow the concrete to cure properly under waterproof covers with good drainage for a minimum of 4-8 hours to prevent damage.

Monitoring cement prices

Monitoring cement prices, including the

JSW cement price

and rate, is also essential to ensure your project remains within budget. Regularly checking for updates can help you make informed purchasing decisions and avoid unexpected cost increases.

Conclusion

Over-reinforcement of concrete is a significant issue that can compromise a structure's safety and integrity. In an under-reinforced beam, the steel reinforcement fails first, making the beam ductile, which means it bends and gives warning before breaking. In an over-reinforced beam, the concrete fails first, causing sudden, brittle failure without warning. Thus, under-reinforced beams are safer because they show signs of distress before failing, while over-reinforced beams break suddenly. Always aim for a balanced approach to reinforcement to ensure your concrete structures are durable, safe, and cost-effective."

However, a prevalent issue with HSC is the occurrence of cracks in walls and columns. These cracks not only mar the aesthetic appeal but also undermine the structural integrity of buildings. This blog delves into the technical strategies to avert cracks in high-strength concrete structures, ensuring longevity and robustness in construction.

Understanding the causes of cracks

Before addressing prevention methods, it is crucial to comprehend the primary causes of cracks in high-strength concrete:

Shrinkage: as concrete cures, it undergoes volumetric changes. Drying shrinkage is particularly significant and can lead to tensile stresses that result in cracking if not properly managed.

Thermal expansion and contraction: concrete expands and contracts with temperature variations. If these movements are restrained, they induce stresses that can cause cracking.

Improper concrete mix: an incorrect proportion of building materials can produce weak concrete prone to cracking.

Inadequate curing: curing is essential for strength development in concrete. Insufficient curing can lead to early-age shrinkage and cracking.

External loads: excessive loads beyond the design capacity can cause stress and cracks in reinforced concrete structures.

Strategies to prevent cracks

To mitigate the risk of cracks in walls or columns, the following technical strategies should be employed:

1. Use a proper concrete mix

Selecting the appropriate concrete mix is fundamental to preventing cracks. High-strength concrete necessitates a meticulously balanced mix of cement, aggregates, water, and admixtures: 

Cement: use

high-quality cement

with appropriate fineness to ensure complete hydration and strength development. 

Aggregates: choose aggregates with low shrinkage potential. Well-graded aggregates reduce voids and minimise water demand. 

Water-cement ratio: maintain a low water-cement ratio (typically between 0.3 to 0.4) to enhance strength and reduce shrinkage. 

Admixtures: incorporate superplasticisers to improve workability and shrinkage-reducing admixtures to minimise drying shrinkage. 

Consulting with a structural engineer or a construction materials expert is advisable to design an optimal concrete mix tailored to specific project requirements.

2. Incorporate reinforced concrete

Reinforced concrete significantly mitigates cracking by improving tensile strength: 

Rebar placement: ensure proper placement and adequate cover of

reinforcement bars

to prevent corrosion and enhance durability. 

Fibre reinforcement: use FRC, including

steel

, glass, or synthetic fibres. These fibres help distribute tensile stresses more evenly, reducing the likelihood of cracking.

3. Implement expansion joints

Expansion joints are crucial for accommodating thermal movements and preventing stress-induced cracks: 

Joint placement: position expansion joints at strategic locations such as changes in wall height, intersections, and at regular intervals along long walls and columns. 

Joint design: design joints to allow sufficient movement while maintaining structural integrity. Use suitable joint fillers and sealants to prevent water ingress.

4. Ensure adequate curing

Proper curing enhances the strength and durability of concrete, reducing the risk of cracks: 

Moist curing: maintain moisture in the concrete using wet burlap, sprinkling, or ponding. This method is effective for large surfaces. 

Membrane curing: apply curing compounds that form a protective membrane on the concrete surface, reducing water evaporation. 

Curing duration: extend curing duration to at least 7 to 14 days, depending on the concrete mix and environmental conditions. More extended curing periods are beneficial for high-strength concrete.

5. Use composite materials

Incorporating composite materials can improve the crack resistance of high-strength concrete: 

Fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP): use FRP composites to reinforce concrete structures. FRP bars are non-corrosive and provide excellent tensile strength. 

High-performance concrete (HPC): consider HPC, which includes pozzolanic materials like silica fumes and fly ash. These materials enhance durability and reduce shrinkage.

6. Control external loads

Designing for appropriate load-bearing capacity is essential to prevent stress-induced cracking: 

Load calculations: perform accurate load calculations considering both dead and live loads. Ensure that the design does not exceed the permissible stress limits of the concrete. 

Structural monitoring: implement structural health monitoring systems to detect and address excessive loads or stress points early.

7. Employ professional expertise

Leveraging the expertise of experienced engineers and construction professionals can significantly reduce the risk of cracks: 

Quality control: ensure strict quality control during material selection, mixing, and construction processes. 

Technical oversight: engage professional oversight to ensure all aspects of the construction process, from concrete mix design to curing, are executed correctly.

Does high-strength concrete crack?

Despite its superior properties, high-strength concrete is only partially immune to cracking. The factors that cause cracks in regular concrete, such as shrinkage, thermal expansion, improper mix, and inadequate curing, also apply to high-strength concrete. However, by adhering to best practices in mix design, curing, and load management, the likelihood of cracks can be significantly minimised.

Conclusion

Preventing cracks in high-strength concrete walls and columns is vital for the longevity and safety of any construction project. Builders can significantly reduce the risk of cracks by understanding the causes of cracks and implementing technical strategies such as using the correct concrete mix, incorporating reinforced concrete, and ensuring proper curing. With the right approach, high-strength concrete structures can achieve the desired strength and durability, providing reliable performance for years."

Heavy rains, high humidity, and unpredictable weather conditions can significantly affect the quality and durability of concrete structures. Proper planning and execution are crucial to ensure that concrete work during the monsoon meets the required standards. This blog will explore the essential considerations and practices for pouring concrete during the monsoon, ensuring your projects stay on track despite the weather.

Weather monitoring and planning

Before commencing any concrete work, keeping a close eye on the weather forecast is essential. Avoid pouring concrete during heavy rains or when thunderstorms are likely. Planning your work around dry spells can help prevent water from mixing with the concrete, which can weaken the structure.

Use high-quality cement

Choosing the right

grade of cement

is crucial, especially during the monsoon. High-quality cement, such as

JSW Cement

, ensures better durability and strength. JSW Cement offers various grades, each suited for different construction needs. Select a grade appropriate for your project, significantly impacting the concrete's performance in wet conditions.

Proper storage of materials

During the monsoon season, moisture can seep into your building materials, compromising their quality. Store cement bags, sand, and aggregates in a dry, covered area. Use tarps or plastic sheets to protect the materials from rain. Ensure that the storage area has proper drainage to prevent water accumulation.

Mixing concrete

The consistency of the concrete mix is vital for achieving the desired strength and durability. During the monsoon, use less water to prevent the mix from becoming too watery. Employ a water-cement ratio that accounts for the moisture already present in the aggregates. Consider using admixtures that improve the workability and water resistance of the concrete.

Site preparation

Ensure the construction site is adequately prepared before pouring concrete. Remove any standing water and ensure the formwork is watertight. If necessary, use a sump pump to remove excess water from the site.

Pouring and curing concrete

Pouring concrete in the monsoon requires extra care. Use plastic sheeting or tarps to cover the concrete immediately after pouring to protect it from rain. Ensure that the concrete is adequately compacted to remove air pockets, which can weaken the structure. Curing is also crucial in the monsoon; keep the concrete covered to retain moisture and achieve proper curing. Use wet burlap or plastic sheets to maintain the moisture level. 

Once the concrete has been finished (between 4-8 hours after pouring) and has set hard enough for walking on, the effects of rain should be minimal. The curing process is a chemical reaction, with ready-mix concrete taking up to 28 days to cure fully. However, if you let your fresh concrete cure under waterproof covers with good drainage for a minimum of 4-8 hours, this should be sufficient to prevent damage.

Monitor cement prices

Construction material prices can fluctuate during the monsoon. Monitor the current

cement price

and JSW cement price to ensure you stay within your budget. Also, regularly check for JSW cement rate updates to make informed purchasing decisions and avoid unexpected cost increases.

Quality control

Regularly test the concrete mix for consistency and strength. Ensure that the formwork is properly sealed to prevent water ingress. Conduct inspections at various stages to identify and address any issues promptly.

Protecting concrete during rain

If bad weather is forecast or you're pouring concrete in the rain, your first step should be to ensure the work site is properly covered with a plastic sheet. It's worth keeping the necessary equipment on hand as a precaution during the rainy season. Protect small slabs from rainwater using plastic sheeting, or use temporary shelters made with large tarps and timber to ensure rainwater doesn't damage larger areas.

Before you start the pour

Ensure that any cavities are free from water, and keep them covered as much as possible.

If it starts raining before you can cover the slab, don't panic. Simply wait until the rain has passed, then pull or push any surface water off the edge of the slab surface before finishing.

This is sometimes done by sliding a garden hose across the slab's surface, wiping away the surface water. 

Concrete should never be poured on top of very wet surfaces, as this will significantly compromise the concrete pour. Good drainage is essential to prevent rainwater pooling in trenches dug for footings, foundations, and slabs. 

Pouring concrete during the monsoon requires meticulous planning and execution. By monitoring the weather, using high-quality materials like JSW Cement, and following best practices for mixing, pouring, and curing, you can ensure that your concrete work withstands the challenges of the rainy season. Stay informed about the latest cement prices and rates to manage your project costs effectively. With careful attention to these factors, you can achieve durable and long-lasting concrete structures, even in the monsoon."

It involves using materials put under tension before being subjected to external loads. This ingenious method of reinforcing concrete has transformed how buildings and bridges are constructed. Wire rods are quite common among the various materials used in pre-stressing concrete, but other options exist. This article will compare wire rods to different materials used in pre-stressed concrete, examining their properties, applications, and performance.

What is pre-stressed concrete?

Pre-stressed concrete

is a form of reinforced concrete where high-strength tendons (typically made of steel) are tensioned before the concrete is cast. When the concrete hardens, the tension is released, compressing the concrete and making the entire structure more resistant to tensile stresses. This process increases the load-carrying capacity and durability of the concrete, allowing for longer spans and more slender structures.
The role of pre-stressing materials
The choice of pre-stressing material plays a vital role in the design and functionality of a pre-stressed concrete structure. It must have high tensile strength, good bond characteristics, and durability to withstand the forces exerted during tensioning and throughout the structure's life.

Wire rod in pre-stressed concrete

One of the primary materials used for pre-stressing is a wire rod. Let's explore its characteristics and how it compares to other materials in terms of performance and application.

Characteristics of wire rod

A

wire rod

is a rolled alloy or non-alloy steel product produced from a semi (e.g., bloom) with a round, rectangular, or cross-section. It's known for its high tensile strength and is often used as strands,

bundles of wire rods

twisted together to form a single tendon.

Advantages of using wire rod

High tensile strength: wire rod provides exceptional tensile strength, which is crucial for pre-stressing applications.

Flexibility: the strands can be easily cut and bent to suit various construction needs, offering more flexibility in design.

Durability: when adequately protected, wire rods can resist corrosion, which is essential for the longevity of concrete structures.

Other materials in pre-stressed concrete
While wire rods are widely used, several other materials are also employed for pre-stressing concrete. Let's compare these alternatives and their unique benefits.

High-strength alloy bars

Alloy bars from high-strength materials such as chromium, vanadium, or nickel steel offer increased yield strength. These bars are often threaded to allow for better anchorage within the concrete.

Advantages:

Greater yield strength: they can withstand higher stress before yielding, which benefits heavy-load applications.

Advantages:

Lightweight: CFRP tendons are significantly lighter than steel, reducing the structure's weight.

Corrosion resistance: they do not rust, eliminating the need for additional protective measures.

Aramid fiber tendons

Aramid fibres like kevlar are synthetic fibres with high tensile strength and thermal stability. They are used in pre-stressed concrete for their durability and excellent performance.

Advantages:

High tensile strength and fatigue resistance: aramid fibres withstand cyclic loading very well, making them suitable for bridges and other structures exposed to repetitive stress.

Thermal stability: they maintain their strength over a wide temperature range.

Performance comparison

When selecting a pre-stressing material, here's how wire rod stacks up against the alternatives.

Tensile strength and elasticity

Wire rod tendons have high tensile strength but can stretch under heavy loads, which may lead to slight elongations over time. In contrast, CFRP and aramid tendons have a lower degree of stretch, providing more consistent performance under stress.

Durability and corrosion resistance

While wire rods are susceptible to corrosion, they can be galvanised or epoxy-coated for protection. CFRP and aramid fibres inherently resist corrosion but can be sensitive to UV exposure and require protective coatings.

Cost-effectiveness

Wire rods are generally more cost-effective than CFRP and aramid fibres, making them popular for many projects. However, the long-term savings from reduced maintenance and longer service life can make the higher initial cost of alternative materials worthwhile.

Applications in construction

Pre-stressing materials are chosen based on the specific requirements of a construction project. Here's where each material excels:

Wire rod for long-span bridges

Wire rods are ideal for long-span bridges requiring high tensile strength and flexibility. Its ability to be formed into strands makes it suitable for complex geometries and large-scale constructions.

CFRP for corrosive environments

CFRP is preferred in environments where corrosion is a significant concern, such as coastal areas or chemical plants. Its corrosion resistance ensures the structure's longevity without frequent maintenance.

Dive deeper into this topic in our latest blog!,Business,3 minutes,what-is-the-importance-of-proper-heat-treatment-in-steel-crankshaft,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"We know how important crankshafts are for car engines. They endure a lot of stress when the engine is running. The materials and methods used to make them depend on the engine type and the specific design of the crankshaft. Using strong materials is crucial to ensure they last a long time. Usually, steel crankshafts are made by shaping them under high pressure (forging), while those made from cast iron are created by pouring molten metal into a mould (casting).  

Heat treatment is crucial in engineering, especially when applied to a specific section of a crankshaft. While we can check the surface characteristics of the treated journal and potentially achieve the desired condition, we can't be sure about the impact on the inside areas of the crankshaft, and we can't measure it. Exposing the crankshaft to localised heat treatment will result in certain parts undergoing heat treatment with unknown effects. This is because heat can transfer through the material or cause phase changes from ferrite/pearlite to martensite or other desired phases. 

A

steel component

's hardening, tempering, or heat treatment involves several steps. These steps alter the material's microstructure and phase changes by exposing the steel to high temperatures, followed by special cooling techniques. Due to its inherent risks, precision and expertise are crucial in executing this process.

Advancements in materials

High-strength steels: new steels with tensile strengths up to 950 MPa are becoming more common, and steels with strengths of 1,000 MPa are expected in the future.

New cast steels: a new type of cast steel called grade 5 is used for crankshaft parts. Its strength is like forged steel, making it a better choice for crankshafts, which usually aren't made from cast steel due to minor internal flaws.

Manufacturing processes

Rotary roll and transverse roll forging: they strengthen crankshafts by placing the toughest layers of

steel

where the stress is highest.

Cold rolling: this process strengthens crankshaft parts by hardening them and adding compressive stress. It can increase strength by 78%.

Hot rolling: This is used to fix small flaws in cast crankshafts, strengthening key areas like pins and fillets.

Quality control and testing

Ladle furnace process: this steel-making method effectively removes impurities and gases like sulfur and oxygen, improving the overall quality of the steel.

Ultrasonic inspection: new machines use ultrasound to accurately find and record internal defects, ensuring high-quality steel.

Proper heat treatment is crucial in the manufacturing of steel crankshafts due to several key reasons:

1. Strength and durability

Heat treatment processes like quenching and tempering enhance the strength and hardness of steel crankshafts. This is vital for crankshafts as they must withstand high stress and load conditions during engine operation. Proper heat treatment ensures that the crankshaft can endure repeated forces without failing.

2. Fatigue resistance

Crankshafts are subjected to cyclic loading, which can lead to fatigue failure. Heat treatment improves the fatigue strength of the steel by refining the grain structure and removing internal stresses. This enhancement in fatigue resistance ensures a longer service life for the crankshaft.

3. Wear resistance

Surface treatments like carburising or nitriding or a combination of both increase crankshaft surfaces' wear resistance important for bearing surfaces and journal areas that experience constant friction. A hardened surface reduces wear and extends the crankshaft's lifespan.

4. Toughness

While hardness is necessary, toughness (the ability to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing) is equally critical. Heat treatment processes are tailored to balance hardness and toughness through proper tempering process, preventing the crankshaft from becoming too brittle and susceptible to fracture under shock loads.

5. Dimensional stability

Proper heat treatment ensures the crankshaft's dimensional stability. It minimizes distortions and warping that can occur during machining and operational stresses. This is essential for maintaining the precise tolerances required for proper engine function and reducing vibrations.

6. Corrosion resistance

Although not the primary function of heat treatment, specific processes can enhance the corrosion resistance of

steel crankshafts

. For example, nitriding can provide a thin, hard, corrosion-resistant layer on the surface, contributing to the crankshaft's overall durability in harsh environments.

7. Stress relief

Heat treatment helps relieve residual stresses introduced during the forging and machining processes. If not properly managed, these residual stresses can lead to cracking or warping during the crankshaft’s operation.

8. Consistent performance

Uniform heat treatment ensures consistent mechanical properties throughout the crankshaft. This consistency is crucial for the engine's balanced and reliable performance, avoiding weak points that could lead to premature failure."

6tzYT64sZ5Dzj6Jewm3TS1,Safeguards to consider when powder coating steel,Factor Impacting Steel Powder Coatings | JSW One MSME Blog,Powder-coated steel is highly resistant to wear and tear no matter what it’s used for. Agreed? Read our blog to know more about factors impacting steel powder coatings and more! ,Product,3 Mins,safeguards-to-consider-when-powder-coating-steel,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Powder coating on steel is a type of coating that is applied as a dry powder and then cured in an oven.

The powder coating process electrostatically charges the powder particles and then sprays them onto the steel surface. The charged particles adhere to the steel and form a uniform coating. The steel is then heated in an oven, which causes the powder to melt and fuse into a smooth and durable finish.

It is a popular method of coating steel products, providing a durable and high-quality finish. Powder coating can be applied to a wide range of steel products, including furniture, car parts, and construction materials.

Powder coating is often applied on steel to provide a protective and decorative finish. The coating helps to prevent corrosion, oxidation, and other forms of wear and tear, making the steel more durable and long-lasting.

Powder coating allows for a wide range of colour options, allowing steel components to be customised to fit a specific aesthetic or branding. Powder coating also provides a smoother finish compared to traditional painting methods, as the dry powder adheres evenly to the surface of the steel.

Environmental factors that might affect the powder coat on steel

1. Temperature

Temperature is one of the most critical factors impacting your powder coat. Powder coating is typically applied in a controlled environment where the temperature is between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature range ensures the powder coat melts and flows evenly, creating a smooth and durable finish.

If the temperature is too high, the powder coat can melt too quickly, causing it to become thin and uneven. If the temperature is too low, the powder coat may not melt, leaving a rough and textured surface. Therefore, it is essential to ensure the temperature is within the recommended range when applying powder coating.

2. Humidity

Humidity is another factor that can impact your powder coat. High humidity can cause the powder to absorb moisture, creating a rough and uneven surface. This is because the powder particles can clump together, creating a textured surface that is not smooth.

To avoid this, applying powder coating in a low-humidity environment is essential. If the humidity is high, you may need to use a dehumidifier or air conditioning to lower the moisture in the air. This will ensure the powder coat can flow smoothly and create a consistent finish.

3. Wind

Strong winds can blow the powder particles away, which makes applying a consistent and even coating difficult. This can result in undercoated or over-coated areas, creating an uneven surface.

Applying powder coating in a sheltered area, away from strong winds, is essential to avoid this. You may also need a windbreak or shield to protect the powder particles from being blown away. This will ensure the powder coat can be applied evenly and create a smooth finish.

4. Rain

Rain can also impact your powder coat, particularly if you apply it outdoors. Moisture from rain can cause the powder to absorb water, creating a textured and rough surface. This can also cause the powder particles to clump together, making it difficult to achieve an even coating.

To avoid this, applying powder coating on a dry day is essential. If there is a chance of rain, you may need to delay the application until the weather is more favourable. You can also cover the surface with a tarp or other protective covering to prevent moisture from getting on the powder.

5. UV Radiation

UV radiation from the sun can also impact your powder coat. UV radiation can cause the powder to fade and discolour over time, making it look dull and worn. This is particularly true for outdoor powder coatings, such as fencing, outdoor furniture, and automotive parts.

To protect your powder coat from UV radiation, you can apply a clear coat or topcoat that is designed to resist UV radiation. This will help to prevent the powder from fading and discolouring over time. You can also store items that have been powder coated in a shaded area to avoid exposure to direct sunlight.

How to prepare steel surfaces for powder coating that lasts

Like any coating, powder coating can be affected by harmful weather conditions if it is not appropriately protected. Here are some steps that you can take to prevent steel's powder coat from harmful weather conditions:

1. Prepare the surface:

Proper surface preparation is crucial to ensure the powder coating adheres well to the steel and forms a strong bond. The surface should be cleaned thoroughly to remove contaminants such as dirt, grease, or rust. You can use a degreaser, a rust remover, or a sandblaster to prepare the surface.

2. Apply a corrosion-resistant primer:

Using a corrosion-resistant primer to the steel before applying the powder coating. This can help to protect the steel from rust and corrosion and provide an extra layer of protection against harmful weather conditions.

3. Apply the powder coating correctly:

To ensure a durable and long-lasting finish, it is crucial to apply it correctly. The powder should be applied evenly and controlled, using the recommended coating thickness and curing temperature. The curing process should be done clean and controlled to prevent contamination.

4. Choose a suitable location for application:

When applying powder coating to steel, choosing a suitable location protected from harmful weather conditions is essential. The location should be sheltered from direct sunlight, rain, wind, and other environmental factors that can affect the curing process and the quality of the finish.

5. Apply a protective topcoat:

To provide additional protection against harmful weather conditions, you can apply a clear coat or topcoat over the powder coating. This can help protect the powder coating from fading, discoloration, and other weather-related damage.

6. Regular maintenance:

To ensure that the powder coating remains in good condition and protected from harmful weather conditions, it is important to perform regular maintenance. This can include cleaning the surface regularly, inspecting for damage, and performing necessary touch-up repairs.

In conclusion, preventing steel powder coats from harmful weather conditions requires proper surface preparation, application of a corrosion-resistant primer, adequate application of the powder coating, choosing a suitable location for application, applying a protective topcoat, and regular maintenance. By taking these steps, you can ensure that your powder coating is well-protected and remains in good condition for many years."

Galvalume steel refers to a type of steel that was developed in the late 20th century. It is a coated steel product with a sheath of powerful aluminum-zinc-silicon alloy, with a high percentage of aluminum. The name derives from the two primary alloys that are used to create this material: aluminum and zinc. It nominally contains 55% aluminum, 43.5% zinc, and 1.5% silicon by weight to affect excellent adhesion to the steel substrate.

Galvalume steel

is often used to make roofing materials. It has better corrosion resistance than other types of zinc-aluminum alloys, and it can be applied with either hot or cold rolling which makes it ideal for applications requiring superior corrosion resistance such as saltwater, marine environments, and high-temperature environments. It is also a popular choice for metal roofing in residential, agricultural, and commercial real estate.

According to market reports, Galvalume steel is rapidly growing in popularity, and Al-Zn-Si is considered the world’s fastest-growing metallic coating. The chief reason is the combination of steel’s strength, malleability, and recyclability, with the scientifically proven anti-corrosion performance of the AI-ZN-SI alloy coating. The result is a cost-effective product that scores high on eco-friendly indices such as recyclability, energy efficiency, and durability. Let’s take a closer look at the many applications of galvalume steel.

Galvalume steel: A revolution in the auto and construction industries?

Galvalume’s unique properties make it suitable for various automotive applications such as vehicle bodies, automotive under-body parts, car wash components, oil filter tubes, license plate brackets, bus steps, hose clamps, and buses (seat backs, panels, floors), etc.

2. Roofing applications

- Contemporary buildings are often built with roofs of varying shapes and pitches. They include steep and moderately steep roofs which require special structures. Galvalume steel is suitable in the majority of cases. Its advantages include –

Versatility - Potential to construct roofs easily of almost any shape

Temperature resistance - Tolerance to temperature changes, and good at low ambient temperatures

Manufacturability – Potential to form into sheets across a wide range of thicknesses

Other material properties - High strength, high resistance to corrosion and oxidation, corrosion-resistant surface coating, good acoustic rating.

3. Walls and siding applications –

Known for its ease in assembling and dismantling, it is widely used in farm, residential, pre-engineered, and storage buildings to act as the vertical component. Galvalume steel also provides a good acoustic rating and thermal insulation.

4. Heating & ventilation applications –

Pre-painted galvalume coils

are used for heating and ventilation applications. Galvalume can withstand temperatures up to 315 degrees Celsius and finds application in air conditioning equipment & HVAC ducts, solar heating panels, heat exchangers, and other industrial HVAC equipment.

5. Agricultural applications

– Galvalume’s longevity makes it adaptable for a variety of agricultural applications ranging from silos (for grain storage), bins (grain, fruit, vegetables, feed storage), curing & drying facilities, and greenhouse frames, to rainwater collection tanks.

6. General use in manufacturing repairs –

One of the major applications of galvalume steel sheets includes the replacement of conventional galvanized and aluminum-coated sheets in automotive repairs, due to their high interchangeability.

Galvalume vs galvanized steel in cars and automotive parts – Which is the right choice for you?

If you’re an MSME or manufacturing firm supplying the automotive industry, chances are you’ve asked yourself which to choose for part manufacturing: galvalume, or galvanized steel? Let’s weigh up the pros and cons of both products -

Strength-to-weight ratio –

Because galvalume steel is enhanced with a coating of lightweight aluminum and zinc, it has a lower weight per volume than galvanized steel, but with comparable tensile strength.

Surface durability and finish –

Due to the coating techniques utilized, galvanized steel has a thinner coating than galvalume. Compared to galvalume, GS is slightly more prone to chipping and flaking when exposed to high temperatures or other harsh conditions, meaning that galvanized steel is more vulnerable to corrosion in areas where it's not protected by paint.

Cost-effectiveness –

Galvalume is economical to produce and process since it uses less material during the coating process. It is also less expensive to use an alloy of aluminum, zinc, and magnesium than zinc alone in the electro-coating process. Unlike GS, galvalume steel production doesn't require the construction of galvanization facilities on-site, further lowering the costs of production.

Appearance –

While the differences between the two coatings are subtle, the galvalume offers a smoother matte appearance, while the galvanized coating is rougher and shinier.

So, while the points of difference between galvalume and galvanized steel are not significant, choosing one over the other is often a matter of preference, budget, and supply availability.

The below techniques can be employed individually or in combination, depending on the structural requirements, seismic hazards, and building design objectives.

Increased cross-sectional area: improving the cross-sectional area of the

steel column

can enhance its capacity to withstand seismic forces. This can be achieved using thicker

steel sections

or increasing the number of steel plates welded together to form a composite column.

Composite columns: composite columns combine steel with concrete to take advantage of both materials' strengths. Concrete can provide additional mass and stiffness, while steel offers ductility and strength. This combination enhances the column's ability to dissipate seismic energy.

Buckling-restrained braces (BRBS): BRBS are devices installed within the steel column to enhance its lateral stiffness and strength. These braces restrain buckling under seismic loads, thus improving the column's performance during an earthquake. They have a steel core surrounded by a casing filled with a low-ductility material such as concrete or grout.

Concentric bracing systems: Concentric types of bracing are opposite  V-bracing,  X-bracing,  2-story  X-bracing, diagonal bracing,  V-bracing,  and  K-bracing, connected to the

steel column

at both ends. They are designed to carry seismic loads by dissipating energy through yielding and plastic deformation, thus reducing the forces transferred to the column.

Added shear reinforcement: lateral reinforcement, such as stirrups and crossbars welded to the column flanges, can enhance the column's ability to resist shear forces during an earthquake.

Prequalified connections: using prequalified connection details, such as moment-resisting or concentrically braced frame connections, ensures that the connections between the steel columns and

beams

are designed to withstand seismic forces.

Base isolation: base isolation systems decouple the building from the ground motion by introducing flexible bearings or isolators between the foundation and the superstructure. While this technique primarily applies to the entire structure, it indirectly benefits steel columns by reducing the seismic forces transmitted to them.

Damping systems: damping devices, such as viscous or tuned mass dampers, can be installed within or adjacent to steel columns to absorb and dissipate seismic energy, reducing the structural response to earthquakes.

Performance-based design: utilising performance-based design approaches allows engineers to tailor reinforcement techniques based on the structure's specific seismic hazards and performance objectives, optimising the seismic resistance of steel columns.

Structural steel beams commonly used in construction for structural reinforcement:

Indian standard medium beams (ISMB): They have a standard 'I' shape with relatively narrow flanges and a tapered web. They are commonly used in construction for various applications, such as building frames, bridges, and industrial structures.

ISMBs

are preferred for medium-span structures where moderate loads are anticipated.

Narrow parallel beams: narrow parallel beams typically refer to beams with

narrow flanges

and a parallel web. These beams are suitable for applications with height restrictions, but the load-bearing capacity is still essential. They are often used when space is limited, such as in mezzanine floors or roofing structures.

Wide parallel beams:

wide parallel beams

have broader flanges than

narrow parallel beams

but maintain a parallel web. They are used in applications where a higher load-bearing capacity is required compared to narrow parallel beams. Wide parallel beams are often employed in heavy-duty industrial buildings, bridges, and other structures where significant loads must be supported over long spans.

Universal beams:

universal beams

, also known as UBS or I-beams, have a distinctive 'I' shape with broad flanges and a tapered web. They are versatile and widely used for various purposes, including building frames, bridges, columns, and other structural elements. Universal beams offer excellent load-bearing capacity and are suitable for small and large-scale construction projects.

In reinforced concrete buildings, vertical columns have two types of steel reinforcement: long bars running vertically and horizontal loops of smaller bars. During earthquakes, these columns can bend or break apart. To prevent this, horizontal loops must be placed closely together, holding vertical bars in place and preventing concrete from bulging. Loop bars should have end hooks to prevent concrete from pushing out and vertical bars from bending. These techniques can be employed individually or in combination, depending on the building's structural requirements, seismic hazards, and design objectives."

To realise this ambitious economic goal, the nation is required to channel a substantial investment of $4.5 trillion into infrastructure development through 2030, as outlined by the Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India. Among the notable projects encompassed within this massive initiative are the Narmada Valley Development Project, Chenab River Railway Bridge, Delhi Metro Industrial Corridor, Mumbai Trans Harbour Link and many more.

The quality and durability of construction materials utilised play a pivotal role in the safety and longevity of these infrastructures. In these materials, Thermo-mechanically Treated (TMT) steel and cement are cornerstones.

TMT steel's remarkable strength

and flexibility make it indispensable for reinforcing concrete structures, while

cement

is the binding agent that holds them together. However, the efficacy of these materials can only be protected if stored and handled correctly. In this article, we delve into the best practices contractors should adhere to when storing and handling TMT steel and cement to ensure the structural integrity and overall success of construction projects.

Section 1: Storing and handling TMT steel

TMT steel bars

have a vital place in the construction industry because of their mechanical properties. Comprising a hard outer layer made up of martensitic structure and a ductile inner core made of ferrite and pearlite mass, TMT steel bars boast high tensile and yield strength, superior bending capability and corrosion resistance. These characteristics make

TMT steel

a prime choice for reinforcing concrete structures, as it effectively counteracts the stresses that buildings endure.

Proper storage practices for TMT steel

To preserve the quality and integrity of TMT steel, contractors must adhere to a set of meticulous storage practices:

Keep away from moisture: TMT steel is susceptible to rust and corrosion when exposed to moisture. Hence, it's imperative to store these bars in a dry environment, preferably under cover.

Elevated platforms: Storing TMT steel bars on raised platforms prevents direct contact with the ground, minimising the risk of moisture absorption and corrosion.

Proper stacking: When stacking TMT steel bars, ensure proper spacing between individual bars to allow air circulation. Avoid tight stacking, as it can lead to the accumulation of moisture and potential deformation.

Regular inspection: Periodic visual inspections of stored

TMT

steel bars are essential. Any signs of rust or corrosion should be addressed promptly to prevent further deterioration.

Handling TMT steel with care

Lifting and transport: During lifting and transportation, employ appropriate equipment and methods to avoid bending, kinking or  damaging of the bars. Use of  slings and cradles can distribute the load evenly and prevent unnecessary stress concentration which can severely decrease the ductility of the bars

Avoid dropping: Droppage of TMT steel bars, even from a relatively low height, can cause microcracks or other damage that may compromise the bars' structural integrity.

Separate grades: If  multiple grades and sizes of TMT steel bars are being used, ensure clear separation and identification during storage and handling to prevent mix-ups that could undermine structural calculations and subsequent applications.

Rust prevention: To prevent rust on TMT steel, use epoxy or galvanised coatings. Regular inspections and maintenance must be carried out to check any early signs of rust formation.

Section 2: Storing and handling cement

Cement, the binding agent in concrete, provides strength and cohesion to structures. It comes in various types, including

Portland cement

, blended cement, and

speciality cement

, each designed for specific applications. Proper storage and handling are essential to avoid issues like moisture infiltration, contamination with dirt or debris, bag damage and to maintain its quality regardless of the type.

Ideal storage conditions for cement

Dry environment: Cement must be stored in a cool, dry place away from humidity and moisture sources. Exposure to moisture can result in caking, which diminishes its usability.

Elevated platform: Similar to TMT steel, elevating

cement bags

prevents direct contact with the ground and safeguard against moisture absorption.

First-in, first-out (FIFO): Adherence to the FIFO principle, using older batches of cement before newer ones. This ensures that the cement used is of optimal quality.

Handling cement safely

Protective gear: When

handling cement

, wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including gloves and dust masks, to shield against skin contact and inhalation of dust.

Avoid overexertion: Lift

cement bags

with proper lifting techniques to prevent strain or injury. Heavy lifting should involve teamwork and, if possible, mechanical aids.

Minimise dust emission: Cement dust can pose respiratory hazards and settle on surfaces, leading to potential contamination. Minimise dust emission by using low-velocity transfer methods and covering open bags.

Conclusion

TMT steel and

cement

are fundamental elements of modern construction, contributing to building and infrastructure's structural stability and durability. However, the success of construction projects hinges on proper storing and handling of these materials. Contractors must prioritise the implementation of best practices outlined in this article, safeguarding

Solar power promotes energy independence, especially in remote areas, and contributes to decentralisation, empowering communities to generate electricity. Innovations in technology continue to drive down solar panel costs, making solar energy more accessible to a broader range of consumers.

Thermo-solar systems:

stainless steel

hot water tanks and heat exchangers are known for their durability and hygienic properties, making them suitable for solar water heating.

Tubing: steel tubing plays a pivotal role in solar tracker systems for solar panels. It is commonly used to construct the structural framework that supports the solar panels or collectors and enables the tracking mechanism. Carbon steel tubing is a preferred choice for solar panel mounts and trackers, as it is sturdy and long-lasting.

Galvanised steel

tubing is also popular, as it is highly resistant to corrosion and rust, making it a suitable option for outdoor and harsh weather environments.

Solar-thermal panels: the use of stainless steel frames in solar panels is noted for their mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance, making them durable under various environmental conditions.

Glazed and unglazed stainless steel panels: solar panel manufacturers in India offer glazed

stainless steel

cushion absorbers and unglazed roofing panels that integrate solar collection directly into building materials, providing both aesthetic and functional benefits.

Photovoltaic systems: it covers the integration of flexible photovoltaic (PV) modules on

stainless steel

roofs, emphasising how stainless steel provides an ideal base for these installations due to its structural integrity and corrosion resistance.

Solar concentrators: solar panel manufacturers in India make concentrated solar power systems using mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a small area, generating heat that can be converted into electricity.

Structural steel

is used in constructing these concentrators due to its strength and ability to maintain shape under high temperatures.

Alternative materials used in solar projects

In addition to steel, several alternative materials find application in solar projects, each with its unique set of characteristics and considerations:

Aluminium: Aluminium is prized for its lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and easy-to-install properties. It is commonly used in solar panel frames and support structures due to its ability to endure outdoor conditions.

Concrete: concrete offers robust structural support and stability. It's commonly used in ground-mounted solar installations where durability and strength are paramount. Concrete foundations provide a sturdy base for solar arrays, particularly in areas with challenging terrain or high wind conditions.

Composite materials: composite materials, such as fibreglass-reinforced plastics (FRP), are gaining traction in the solar industry due to their lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and customisable properties. They offer versatility in design and can be tailored to specific project requirements.

Comparison of durability against steel

A. Corrosion susceptibility: steel is susceptible to corrosion, especially in harsh environmental conditions, but advancements in coatings and galvanisation techniques have significantly mitigated this issue. Aluminium is naturally corrosion-resistant due to its oxide layer, while concrete and composite materials also offer good resistance with proper sealing and maintenance.

B. Structural integrity over time: steel structures have demonstrated excellent long-term structural integrity, with proper maintenance ensuring their longevity. Aluminium structures also maintain their strength over time but may require more frequent inspections for signs of corrosion. Concrete offers exceptional durability, especially in ground-mounted installations, while composite materials' longevity depends on the specific formulation and environmental exposure.

C. Environmental impact and sustainability: steel and aluminium are highly recyclable materials, contributing to their sustainability profile. Concrete, while durable, has a higher carbon footprint due to its manufacturing process. Composite materials can have various environmental impacts depending on their composition and recycling capabilities.

Structural support, mounting systems, and custom fabrication allow steel to mould into various shapes and sizes, ensuring panels are securely positioned for optimal energy capture. Whether through adjustable tilt angles for seasonal efficiency or integration into building structures for seamless aesthetics, steel offers durability and scalability essential for solar installations. Its resilience against environmental stressors and low maintenance needs further solidify its role in advancing renewable energy initiatives, making steel a foundational element in the transition to sustainable power sources."
2r1DaTelRtIGnj82M3IdVE,Different types of stainless steel grades,Best Quality Stainless Steel | SS Grades | JSW One MSME Blog,Looking forward to choosing the best quality stainless steel and grade for your end applications? Read our blog to know the popular types of stainless steel and their characteristics.,Product,3 Mins,different-types-of-stainless-steel-grades,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"All stainless steel alloys have distinct physical properties such as tensile strength, corrosion resistance, melting points, and oxidation resistance. This article aims to give you the awareness to choose the

best quality stainless steel

and grade suited for your end applications. Here is a summary of the most popular types of stainless steel and their characteristics.

Five main categories of stainless steel:

1.

Austenitic stainless steel:

this is the most commonly used stainless steel variant. Compared to other steel alloys, austenitic stainless steels typically have a higher chromium concentration, which increases their corrosion resistance. The tendency for austenitic stainless steel alloys to lack magnetic properties, though possible after cold treatment, is another shared feature of these materials.

2. Ferritic stainless steel:

this is the second most commonly used variant after austenitic stainless steel. Ferritic stainless steel is magnetic, as the name suggests. Cold working can be used to harden these alloys. Due to their lower nickel content, they are also less expensive.

3. Duplex (ferritic-austenitic) stainless steels:

the name 'duplex' for this subcategory of stainless steel comes from its composition of equal amounts of austenite and delta-ferrite. These stainless steel alloys outperform austenitic stainless steels in terms of tensile strength and corrosion resistance, particularly regarding chloride pitting. Duplex stainless steels are frequently used for pipelines and pressure vessels in the petrochemicals industry and pipework systems in the oil and gas sector due to their physical characteristics and chemical resistance.

4. artensitic stainless steels:

this is the least common category of stainless steel. Despite having a higher hardness than ferritic or austenitic alloys, its corrosion resistance is typically lower. Martensitic stainless steel alloys are often the best choice for applications requiring extremely high tensile strength and impact resistance.

Within each of the above categories, there are various

grades of stainless steel

; the most popular types of each are broken down below:

Austenitic stainless steels

Grade 301 –

301 steel is made with additives of nickel and chromium. It is both robust and ductile when cold worked. Grade 301 stainless steel is frequently used in welding, forming, and drawing thanks to these qualities.

Grade 302 –

grade 302 stainless steel is very similar to grade 304 stainless steel, except that it contains higher carbon levels. It is particularly used for its capacity to withstand caustic chemicals, solvents, and acids. Conical compression springs made of grade 302 stainless steel are often used in kitchen appliances, food processing machinery, and medical applications.

Grade 303 –

This grade is not as resistant to corrosion as grade 304; it cannot be hardened by heat treatment. Heavy-duty machined components, including gears, aviation fittings, screws, shafts, nuts, and bolts, frequently employ grade 303.

Grade 304 –

grade 304 is the most versatile variant of austenitic stainless steel. Grade 304 stainless steel stands out even among steel alloys for its high tensile strength, approximately 621 MPa (90 ksi). Because of its tensile strength, temperature, and corrosion resistance, 304 stainless steel is used for various applications.

Grade 309 –

this nickel-chromium stainless steel's higher tensile strength and chemical resistance are similar to those of grade 304. Grade 309 is suitable for heat applications because it can tolerate extremely high temperatures. For high-heat applications such as furnace parts, aircraft engines, automotive exhaust systems, and oven liners, grade 309 is frequently utilised.

Ferritic stainless steel

Grade 405 -

due to its weaker corrosion resistance, grade 405 stainless steel is appropriate for mild corrosive applications. Grade 405 SS does not harden when the material is cooled after welding procedures because of the additional aluminium it contains. It is used for applications like steam nozzles and quenching racks.

Grade 408 -

although this type of stainless steel has weak corrosion resistance, it has good heat resistance. It is made from a combination of 8% nickel and 11% chromium.

Grade 409 -

both high-temperature tolerance and corrosion resistance characteristics are present in grade 409. It is particularly resistant to exhaust gas and atmospheric corrosion and is consequently used in automobile applications, including exhaust systems.

Grade 420 -

With 12% chromium and a 50HRC hardness, this grade of stainless steel is the hardest of all the grades. It also has good ductility and corrosion resistance, particularly against alkalis, fresh water, foods, and mild acids. Grade 420 stainless steel is often used to make cutlery, though prolonged exposure to certain food substances can cause pitting.

Duplex stainless steel

Grade 2205 -

with the addition of nitrogen, grade 2205 stainless steel is intended to withstand stress corrosion cracking, pitting, and crevice corrosion. As a result, grade 2205 has corrosion resistance that is over two times greater than that of other austenitic steels. Applications needing high strength and great corrosion resistance are used grade 2205 in the oil and gas, petrochemical, maritime, and pulp and paper sectors.

Grade 2304 -

grade 2304 has over twice the yield strength of grade 316 and comparable austenitic steels yet has the same level of corrosion resistance. It can also function well in cooler climates, with few exceptions. Most uses for this material fall between -58°F and 572°F.

Grade 2507

- this duplex stainless steel has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, strong chloride stress corrosion resistance, and high thermal conductivity. Applications requiring exceptional corrosion resistance and high tensile strength are best served by grade 2507. Applications for grade 2507 stainless steel include offshore oil platforms, marine and petrochemical equipment, and various mechanical and structural parts.

Martensitic stainless steel

Grade 410:

grade 410 is a general-purpose martensitic stainless steel that offers corrosion resistance properties that can be enhanced through hardening, polishing, and tempering. Even though martensitic stainless steel alloys like grade 410 perform well in mild corrosive settings, they are not as corrosion-resistant as austenitic steels.

Grade 414:

grade 410 stainless steel is essentially grade 410 with nickel added. Nickel addition also makes it more robust than grade 410. This steel is frequently used to create valve seats, beater bars, forged shafts and spindles, fasteners, and mining equipment.

Grade 416:

grade 416 stainless steel boasts the highest machinability of any stainless steel with a rating of 85%. Considering this property and its affordability, grade 416 stainless steel is available in a range of finishes, including severely tempered, hardened, and unhardened. Although grade 416 is extremely resistant to fresh water, acids, and alkalis, it has less corrosion resistance than austenitic steels. Automatic screw-machined parts, gears, bolts, and washing machine parts are common uses.

and concrete are vital for modern construction. Cement acts as a binding agent, and concrete offers versatility, durability, and strength. They contribute to sustainable development, are recyclable, energy-efficient, and help reduce carbon emissions. To maintain the construction project's structural integrity and aesthetics, we have prepared a guide to some typical concrete issues, along with their solutions and prevention measures.

1. Cracks:

Identify the type of crack (like shrinkage, settlement, structural) to determine the underlying cause.

Shrinkage cracks: Thin, straight, caused by concrete drying and shrinking.

Settlement cracks: Reflect uneven support beneath concrete, often wider at one end.

Structural cracks: Wider, deeper, caused by excessive loads or foundation movement.

Prevention:

Proper mix design and adequate curing to minimise shrinkage.

Use of control joints to manage crack locations.

Ensure proper subgrade preparation to prevent settlement.

2. Scaling:

Scaling occurs when the concrete surface flakes off due to freeze-thaw cycles or poor finishing practices. For instance, overworking the surface during finishing can weaken surface integrity and failure to adequately seal the surface.

Prevention:

Use air-entrained concrete in regions prone to freezing temperatures.

Proper curing methods include covering the concrete with plastic sheeting or curing compounds.

Please don't finish concrete prematurely when bleed water is still present.

3. Spalling:

Spalling is the chipping or breaking off of concrete surfaces, often due to corrosion of reinforcement or freeze-thaw cycles.

Prevention:

Adequate concrete cover over reinforcement to protect against corrosion.

Use of corrosion inhibitors or stainless steel reinforcement.

Proper drainage and waterproofing to prevent water penetration.

4. Surface Crusting:

Surface crusting appears as a thin layer of weak concrete on the surface, often caused by improper finishing techniques or rapid evaporation of surface water.

Prevention:

Use fog sprayers, evaporation retardants, or windbreaks to slow down surface water evaporation.

Proper timing of finishing operations to avoid premature drying.

Adequate curing measures to maintain moisture levels in the concrete.

5. Dusting:

Dusting occurs when the surface of concrete becomes powdery due to poor mix design, over-troweling, or improper curing.

Prevention:

Use of proper mix proportions with adequate

cement content

.

Avoid over-troweling during finishing to prevent weakening of the surface.

Ensure adequate curing to promote strength development and reduce surface dusting.

6. Discoloration:

Discolouration can result from various factors, including improper curing, inconsistent mixing, or contamination during placement.

Prevention:

Consistent mixing and batching practices.

Proper curing methods, such as moist or curing compounds, prevent uneven hydration and discolouration.

Prevent contamination during placement by maintaining clean equipment and formwork.

7. Honeycombing:

Honeycombing appears as voids or gaps in the concrete surface, often due to inadequate compaction or poor formwork.

Prevention:

Proper vibration and compaction during concrete placement.

Ensure proper formwork design and construction to prevent leakage and complete mould filling.

Proper consolidation techniques to eliminate air voids and ensure proper concrete compaction.

8. Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR):

ASR occurs when alkalis in the

cement

react with certain types of aggregate (like gravel, crushed stone, sand, Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) or crushed slag), leading to expansion and cracking over time.

Prevention:

Use of low-alkali cement or supplementary cementitious materials.

Selection of non-reactive aggregates.

Proper mix design and testing to identify potential reactive aggregates.

Construction professionals can ensure durable and aesthetically pleasing concrete structures by understanding these common problems, implementing effective troubleshooting techniques, and employing preventive measures. Regular inspection and maintenance are essential for identifying and addressing issues before escalating."

",Product,3 minutes,where-is-portland-pozzolana-cement-ppc-used,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC)

is a

cement

type produced by blending Portland cement clinker with pozzolanic materials. There are two types of

pozzolana

: natural and artificial. Natural pozzolana is made up of calcined materials such as volcanic ash, pumicite, shales, and clay. Artificial pozzolana includes burnt clay, silica fume, fly ash, and blast furnace slag. The primary components of PPC are:

Portland cement clinker: This is the main ingredient of PPC and is produced by heating a mixture of limestone, clay, and other materials in a kiln at high temperatures of 800-1,000 degrees Celsius.

Portland cement clinker

blended with gypsum (which controls the setting time) provides the fundamental strength and binding properties to the cement.

Pozzolanic materials: Pozzolanic materials are finely divided siliceous or siliceous and aluminous materials that react with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in the presence of water to form cementitious compounds. Common pozzolanic materials used in PPC include fly ash, volcanic ash, calcined clay, and silica fume.

During the hydration process (when the cement hardens) of PPC cement, the pozzolanic materials react with calcium hydroxide produced during the hydration of Portland cement clinker to form additional cementitious compounds, such as calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel and calcium aluminate hydrates. These additional cementitious compounds improve the cementitious matrix's strength, durability, and workability.

PPC cement offers several advantages over

Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)

, including:

Improved workability: the addition of pozzolanic materials enhances the workability of PPC cement, making it easier to mix, place, and finish.

Reduced heat of hydration:

PPC cement

exhibits lower heat of hydration than OPC, which reduces the risk of thermal cracking in large concrete structures.

Enhanced durability: the pozzolanic reaction leads to the formation of additional cementitious compounds, resulting in improved durability and resistance to chemical attacks, sulphate attacks, and alkali-silica reactions.

Environmental benefits: using pozzolanic materials in PPC cement reduces the consumption of clinker, reducing carbon dioxide emissions associated with cement production.

PPC, recognized as the best cement in construction boasts several typical applications:

Concrete production: PPC cement is used for various construction purposes, including residential buildings, commercial structures, bridges, dams, roads, and pavements.

Masonry work: It is used for bricklaying, blockwork, plastering, and other masonry applications due to its ability to enhance workability and reduce the heat of hydration.

Precast concrete products: PPC cement is used to manufacture precast concrete products such as blocks, pipes, tiles, and other specialised concrete elements.

Marine structures: Due to their resistance to sulphate attacks and durability in aggressive environments, PPC cement is suitable for constructing marine structures like ports, harbours, and coastal protection structures.

Underground structures: Its ability to resist corrosion and sulphate attacks makes PPC cement suitable for constructing underground structures such as tunnels, underground parking lots, and sewage systems.

Mass concrete structures: PPC cement is used in mass concrete structures such as dams, retaining walls, and heavy foundations due to its low heat evolution and reduced risk of thermal cracking.

Store PPC cement in weather-proof buildings to prevent dampness. Ensure easy access for inspection.

Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)

is produced when Portland cement clinker is ground with gypsum. However, when the clinker is ground with pozzolana, it results in the creation of PPC. Similarly, when the clinker is ground with slag, it produces

, a fundamental component in construction, is produced through a complex manufacturing process involving various stages and raw materials. The process begins with extracting raw materials through quarrying or mining methods, depending on the type of rock. Hard rocks like limestone, slates, and certain shales are typically quarried and may require blasting, while softer rocks like chalk and clay can be excavated directly.

Once extracted, the raw materials are transported to the crushing plant using trucks, railway freight cars, conveyor belts, or ropeways. They can be transported in either dry or wet states, with some regions employing pipelines for slurry transportation. In areas lacking limestone with sufficient lime content, beneficiation processes such as froth flotation may be used to upgrade the raw materials, albeit at a higher cost.

The manufacturing of Portland cement, the most commonly used

type of cement

, involves four main stages: crushing and grinding of raw materials, blending of materials in correct proportions, burning the prepared mix in a kiln, and grinding the resulting product known as ‘clinker’ along with gypsum to control setting time. These stages can be carried out using wet, dry, or semi-dry processes, depending on the moisture content of the raw materials.
Measures such as enhancing energy efficiency, utilising renewable energy sources, and implementing carbon capture and storage technologies are being explored to mitigate these environmental impacts. Additionally, research into novel cement and alternative formulations that reduce the reliance on clinker production is underway to address these challenges.

The crushing and grinding stage involves reducing the raw materials into fine particles using crushers and mills. Blending ensures the desired chemical composition of the cement by combining materials from different batches. Burning occurs in kilns, with modern plants predominantly utilising rotary kilns, where the raw materials are heated to high temperatures to form clinker. Dust emissions from kilns are managed through various systems, such as cyclone arrestors and bag-filter systems.

Grinding the clinker and gypsum mixture produces the final cement product, which is then stored in silos before packaging or bulk dispatch.

Portland cement

primarily consists of four main compounds: tricalcium silicate (C3S), dicalcium silicate (C2S), tricalcium aluminate (C3A), and a tetra-calcium aluminoferrite (C4AF), along with other minor components. Upon hydration, these compounds form calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) and calcium hydroxide (CH), which bind the cement and concrete together.

The strength and

durability of cement

are influenced by its composition and fineness. Various factors, including the presence of alumina and iron compounds, influence the cement's resistance to chemical attack and its heat of hydration. Despite the challenges posed by its production, ongoing research and technological advancements aim to improve the sustainability of cement manufacturing while meeting the demands of construction projects worldwide.

In India, Portland cement is manufactured according to the Indian Standard IS 269:2015, which categorises Portland cement into various types based on their composition and intended use. The most commonly used types of Portland cement in India are:

The Indian cement industry is the world's second-largest, accounting for over 8% of the global installed capacity. However, contractors often grapple with the challenges posed by

cement price

fluctuations . Usually, price fluctuations lead to investment pressure, increase construction costs,  reduce investment profit, affect investment decision-making and cause disputes that reduce overall project progress. The contractors must maintain a firm grip on expenses, especially when dealing with unpredictable changes in cement prices, to ensure that construction projects are completed successfully within budgetary constraints. Our blog aims to offer recommendations to help contractors effectively manage the fluctuations in cement prices.

Understanding the dynamics of cement price fluctuations

Before delving into strategies for managing and budgeting for cement price fluctuations, it's essential to understand the factors that influence these fluctuations. Cement prices are subject to a complex interplay of supply and demand, market conditions, and global economic trends. Some key factors contributing to price volatility include:

Raw material costs: Cement production relies on natural materials like limestone, clay, and gypsum. Fluctuations in the prices of these materials can significantly impact cement costs.

Energy prices: Cement production is energy-intensive, and changes in energy costs, especially for fossil fuels, can drive up or down the price of cement.

Transportation costs: The cost of

transporting cement

from manufacturing facilities to construction sites is sensitive to fuel prices, infrastructure conditions, and geopolitical factors.

Market demand: Economic conditions, construction activity levels, and infrastructure projects can influence direction, affecting prices accordingly.

Global events: Political instability, trade disputes, and unforeseen international events can disrupt the supply chain and lead to short-term price spikes.

Strategies for managing cement price fluctuations

Set a budget: Determine your budget for the

cement procurement

. A predefined budget will help you make informed decisions based on your financial capabilities.

Buy in bulk or lock-in prices: Consider purchasing cement in larger quantities. Many suppliers offer volume discounts, which can help you lock in a lower price per unit, especially during price spikes.

Example: If you order 10,000 bags upfront, you can secure a 5% discount and lock in the rate for the entire project.

Optimise cement content: Concrete producers can optimise

cement

content with lower-cost performance - Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs) like fly ash, slag cement, and silica fume to control costs when the price of cement rises.

Example: Substituting 20% of cement with fly ash in your concrete mix reduces costs without sacrificing performance.

Diversify suppliers: Relying on a single cement supplier can leave you vulnerable to their pricing strategies. Diversify your supplier base to access competitive pricing and reduce dependence on a single source. Online platforms, like JSW One MSME, have different suppliers for various

types of cement

.

Inventory management: Maintain an inventory of cement when prices are favourable. This stockpile can serve as a buffer during price spikes, allowing you to continue work without disruptions.

Example: During low cement prices, you purchase an extra 1,000 bags of cement and store them securely. You tap into this inventory when prices rise unexpectedly, preventing cost spikes and project delays.

Cost-plus contracts: Consider using cost-plus agreements for clients willing to accept a variable material cost component. This approach can help pass on price increases to clients when necessary.

Example: In a cost-plus construction contract with a client, you agree to pass on any material cost increases. If cement prices rise by 10%, the client agrees to cover the additional costs, ensuring your project remains financially viable.

Constant monitoring: Stay vigilant and monitor market trends regularly. Knowing potential price fluctuations allows you to adjust your budget and procurement strategies accordingly. Start with an exact cost estimation that includes current cement prices. Use historical data and industry benchmarks to project potential price changes.

Contingency budget: Include a contingency budget line item for material price fluctuations. This reserve can absorb unexpected increases in

Click here to read about the advantages of JSW Green Cement!,Business,3 MIns,is-green-cement-the-future-of-sustainable-construction,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Green cement

is a groundbreaking innovation in the construction industry that offers an environment-friendly and sustainable alternative to traditional cement. Its production can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of cement manufacturing, which currently accounts for approximately 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions.

Using green cement can address this issue and help minimise the environmental impact of construction. Get a comprehensive understanding of green cement – the future of sustainable construction in this article.

What is Green Cement?

Green cement is eco-friendly and produced using a carbon-negative manufacturing process. Industrial waste materials such as slag from blast furnaces and fly ash are mainly used to make this cement. The manufacturing process of green cement is highly energy-efficient thanks to advanced technology, resulting in a significantly lower carbon dioxide emission than traditional cement production. Furthermore, using industrial waste materials as raw materials makes

green cement

more affordable than traditional cement.

The Sustainability of Green Cement

The construction industry has always strived for stronger, more durable, sustainable concrete. Green cement is the ideal solution as it is environmentally friendly, utilising industrial waste and producing fewer carbon dioxide emissions while requiring less energy.

In addition,

green cement

is highly durable and has a long lifespan, with exceptional early strength, resilience, durability, crack resistance, and low chloride permeability. Its corrosion resistance is three to four times that of ordinary cement.

Green cement is a more practical option for large constructions because of its higher tangibility, resulting from its calcinated clay and limestone composition. These ingredients help to reduce porosity, thereby improving mechanical strength.

Green cement can also be hybridised easily, promoting more durable and sustainable construction. This contributes to green cement's comparatively higher tensile strength than conventional concrete.

Green Cement Advantages

Green Cement has several advantages over traditional Portland cement. Some of them are –

Reduced carbon footprint:

Green cement emits fewer greenhouse gases during production than traditional cement. This is because it uses alternative materials, such as fly ash, blast furnace slag, or pozzolana, that are abundant and produce less CO2 during manufacturing.

Energy efficiency:

The production of green cement requires less energy than traditional cement. This is because it uses less clinker, a key component of traditional cement that requires a high-temperature manufacturing process.

Durability:

Green cement is often more durable than traditional cement. This is because it is produced using materials that can improve the compressive strength, porosity, and resistance to the chemical attack of the cement.

Cost-effectiveness:

Green cement can be cost-effective in the long run. Although it may be more expensive to produce initially, it can result in lower maintenance and repair costs over time due to its improved durability.

Sustainable sourcing:

The materials used in green cement production are often sourced from local or recycled sources, reducing transportation costs and promoting sustainability.

With extensive construction work all over India, there is a growing concern about air pollution and environmental degradation. In response to this issue, we must start making the switch to sustainable and eco-friendly construction materials.

JSW Cement

is one such eco-friendly construction, which is eco-friendly and provides superior durability and strength. The use of industrial by-products in its production also helps to reduce waste and promote sustainable sourcing of materials. In addition, JSW Green Cement has a significantly lower cost compared to traditional cement, making it a cost-effective option for construction projects.

",Business ,3 minutes,strategies-and-materials-for-rainy-season-corrosion-in-structural-steel,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Structural steel

stands out when constructing long-lasting buildings due to its strength, ductility and versatility. However, the rainy season can significantly threaten steel structures, as increased moisture levels accelerate corrosion. In this blog, we'll explore ways steel beams, columns, and other structural elements are protected against corrosion.

Understanding structural steel

Structural steel is known for its high strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility in design. It is commonly used in the form of

steel beams

,

channels

and

angles

, I-beams, and

columns

to create the framework of buildings. An I-section beam, also known as an I-beam, is one of the most prevalent shapes used in steel structures due to its efficiency in bearing loads.

Types of columns in steel structures

Columns: these are critical vertical elements in steel structures, providing essential support to transfer loads from the beams to the foundations. The main types of columns include: 

Hollow Structural Sections (HSS): these are often square, rectangular, or circular in cross-section in the form of hollow tubes and are known for their high strength and aesthetic appeal.

Wide flange columns (W-columns): like

I-beams

, W-columns have parallel flanges, providing excellent load-bearing capacity. 

Built-up columns: made by welding or bolting multiple steel plates, these columns can be customised for specific structural requirements.

The challenge of corrosion

Corrosion is the gradual degradation of materials, usually metals, due to chemical reactions with their environment. In steel's case, exposure to moisture and oxygen leads to iron oxide, commonly known as rust. During the rainy season, the high humidity and persistent wet conditions can significantly speed up this process, compromising the structural integrity of steel elements.

Atmospheric corrosion

Atmospheric corrosion occurs when steel is exposed to the natural atmosphere, including varying humidity levels, temperature, and pollutants. The primary factors affecting atmospheric corrosion are:

Humidity: high humidity levels can accelerate corrosion by providing moisture necessary for electrochemical reactions.

Temperature: higher temperatures generally increase the rate of corrosion.

Pollutants: industrial pollutants such as chlorides, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxidesolor (NO) can form acidic compounds when combined with moisture, significantly accelerating corrosion.

Prevention measures

Applying protective coatings such as paints, galvanisation, or other corrosion-resistant coatings.

Using corrosion inhibitors.

Implementing regular maintenance and inspections.

2. Galvanic corrosion

Galvanic corrosion occurs when two metals or alloys are electrically connected to an electrolyte (e.g., water). The more anodic (less noble) metal corrodes preferentially to the more cathodic (noble) metal. Key factors include:

Electrochemical potential difference: the more significant the difference in the electrode potential of the two metals, the higher the risk of galvanic corrosion.

Electrical conductivity: the presence of a conductive path for the flow of electrons.

Electrolyte presence: typically water with dissolved salts, acids, or alkalis.

Prevention measures

Avoiding dissimilar metal contacts.

Applying insulating materials between different metals.

Using sacrificial anodes to protect the more valuable metal.

3. Crevice corrosion

Crevice corrosion occurs in confined spaces where stagnant solutions can become trapped, such as under gaskets, washers, or fasteners. Factors influencing crevice corrosion include:

Oxygen depletion: limited oxygen in the crevice compared to the surrounding area can lead to differential aeration, causing localised corrosion.

Acidic conditions: accumulation of acidic by-products within the crevice.

Concentration of corrosive species: higher concentration of chlorides or other aggressive ions within the crevice.

Prevention measures

Designing joints and assemblies to avoid crevices by avoiding very sharp corners.

Sealing joints to prevent the ingression of corrosiand ve solutions.

Using corrosion-resistant materials.

4. Pitting corrosion

Pitting corrosion is a localised form of corrosion that forms small holes or pits in the metal. It is particularly insidious because it can cause rapid penetration of the metal while the overall corrosion rate may appear low. Influencing factors include:

Presence of chloride ions: chlorides are highly aggressive and can disrupt the passive film on metals, leading to pitting.

Metal composition: certain alloying elements such as Mo, N, and Cr can increase resistance to pitting.

Environmental conditions: temperature, PH, and other factors can influence pitting propensity.

Prevention measures

Using high-alloy steels with good pitting resistance, such as stainless steel with higher chromium and molybdenum content.

Maintaining clean surfaces and avoiding stagnant conditions.

Applying protective coatings and cathodic protection such as galvanised or galvalume coatings.

Methods to enhance corrosion resistance

To protect

steel structures

from corrosion, especially during the rainy season, several methods can be employed:

Protective coatings

Paints and epoxy coatings: applying a layer of paint or epoxy resin creates a barrier that prevents moisture and oxygen from reaching the steel surface. 

Galvanisation: this process involves coating steel with a layer of zinc, which acts as a sacrificial anode, corroding in place of the steel.

Corrosion inhibitors

Chemical compounds can be added to the environment surrounding the steel, reducing the corrosion rate. These inhibitors can be mixed with concrete or applied as a spray.

How corrosion inhibitors work

Corrosion inhibitors interact with the metal surface to form a protective film. There are three types of these films: 

Passivating film: these are thin, oxide films (30–200 å thick) that provide excellent protection. Examples include chromates and nitrites, though they are less used today due to toxicity concerns, except in critical areas like aerospace and construction. Other examples like tungstates and molybdates work in the presence of air. 

Precipitation film: these inhibitors react with soluble species in the environment or with the metal to form a protective layer. For example, phosphonates and polyphosphates form films with calcium ions, while copper-benzotriazole forms a film with copper ions. These films might be porous and not perfectly adherent, but still offer decent protection. 

Adsorption film: these inhibitors are usually organic molecules that attach to the metal surface. They have a part that bonds with the metal and a part that sticks out into the solution, reducing the metal's contact with oxygen and water, thus slowing down corrosion.

Proper design and maintenance

Ensuring that steel structures are designed with proper drainage and ventilation can minimise water retention and reduce the risk of corrosion. Regular maintenance, such as inspecting and repairing protective coatings, is also essential. Cleaning and disposal of corrosion products, if any by some mechanical or chemical means can also minimize further corrosion.

Role of structural steel fabricators

Structural steel fabricators

play a crucial role in the construction process, from designing and creating steel components to implementing corrosion protection measures. Experienced fabricators understand the importance of selecting suitable materials and protective methods to ensure the durability and safety of steel structures, especially in environments.

Conclusion

Corrosion resistance in structural steel is critical for any construction project, particularly during the rainy season. By understanding the various methods and materials available to protect steel from corrosion and collaborating with skilled structural steel fabricators, you can ensure the longevity and integrity of your steel structure building."

",Business,3 minutes,what-is-slab-beam-column-and-footing-construction,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Construction is an intricate process that involves numerous components working together to create a stable, durable structure.

Slabs, beams, columns, and footings

ensure the structural integrity of buildings. In this blog, we will delve into the specifics of each element and the materials commonly used, focusing on

mild steel

(MS) and its properties.

Slab construction

What is a slab?

A slab is a flat, horizontal structural element that creates building floors and ceilings. It provides a solid surface and distributes loads to the underlying beams and columns. Slabs are typically made from reinforced concrete, which offers excellent compressive strength.

Types of slabs

One-way slab: supported by

beams

on two opposite sides, where loads are transferred in one direction.

Two-way slab: supported by beams on all four sides, distributing loads in two directions.

Flat slab: directly supported by

columns without beams

, ideal for commercial buildings.

Hollow core slab: precast slabs with hollow sections to reduce weight and improve efficiency.

Materials used

Steel reinforcement is critical in slab construction.

Mild steel (MS)

, known for its ductility and strength, is often used as reinforcing bars (rebars). The price of mild

steel per kg

can vary based on market conditions but is a significant factor in the overall construction cost.

Beam construction 

What is a beam?

Materials used

Beams are often made from steel due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. Mild steel is commonly used, offering a balance of strength, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. The mild steel price per kg is a crucial consideration in budgeting for beam construction.

Column construction

What is a column?

A column is a vertical structural element that transfers loads from the beams and slabs to the footings. Columns are essential for supporting a building's weight and maintaining its stability.

Types of columns

Rectangular or square columns: common in residential buildings for their simplicity and ease of construction.

Circular columns: often used in high-rise buildings and bridges due to their aesthetic appeal and uniform load distribution.

L- and t- shaped columns: used in corner and T-junctions of structures to support adjacent walls and beams.

Materials used

Steel columns provide significant advantages due to their strength and ability to withstand compressive loads. Mild steel, known for its excellent properties, is a preferred choice in column construction.

Footing construction

What is a footing?

Footings are the foundational elements that distribute the structure's load to the soil. They are critical in preventing excessive settlement and ensuring the building's stability.

Types of footings

Strip footing: a continuous strip of concrete supporting load-bearing walls.

Isolated footing: supports individual columns, typically used in residential buildings.

Raft footing: large continuous slab supporting multiple columns and walls, ideal for poor soil conditions.

Pile footing is used when the soil is weak. It involves long columns (piles) driven deep into the ground.

Materials used

Footings are usually made from reinforced concrete, incorporating steel reinforcement to enhance tensile strength, ductility  and durability. Due to their favourable properties, mild steel rebars are commonly used in footing construction.

Steel in construction

Steel is a fundamental material in modern construction, known for its versatility and strength. Steel beams, such as ISMB, NPB, WPB, and UB, are used based on specific structural requirements. Mild steel is widely used due to its balance of strength, ductility, and affordability. The properties of mild steel, including its tensile strength and resistance to corrosion, make it an ideal choice for reinforcing concrete elements.

Mild steel properties

Ductility: allows for significant deformation before failure, providing warning signs of structural issues.

Strength: offers high tensile strength, used in reinforcing concrete structures.

Cost-effectiveness: relatively low cost per kg compared to other materials, making it a popular choice in construction.

A stable building structure relies on slabs, beams, columns, and footings working together to support loads and ensure stability. Slabs make up the floors and ceilings, distributing loads to the beams. The beams then transfer these loads to the vertical columns, which carry the forces down to the footings. Footings spread these loads over a larger area to prevent excessive settlement and ensure the structure remains stable. This hierarchical load transfer—from slabs to beams to columns to footings—ensures effective and safe distribution of loads to the ground, maintaining the building's integrity."

Make informed decisions with our comprehensive guide.",Business,3 minutes,tmt-vs-tmx-vs-hysd,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"TMT (

thermo-mechanically treated

) steel undergoes a thermo-mechanical treatment process, giving them higher strength and better flexibility than traditional hot-rolled steel. These are often preferred for constructions requiring bending or shaping, like building columns or beams. On the other hand, TMX (thermo-mechanically treated extended) bars take this a step further with an extended thermo-mechanical treatment process. Then there are HYSD (high yield strength deformed) bars, which subject mild steel to hot or cold working processes followed by quenching and tempering. Understanding the differences between these materials is essential in construction and engineering because it helps engineers choose the right type of steel bar for the specific requirements of their project.

TMT bars

TMT bars

are manufactured using a unique controlled cooling process after rolling.

This treatment imparts higher strength to the bars than traditional

hot-rolled steel

bars.

TMT bars have better ductility and bendability, making them suitable for construction where flexibility is required.

They also have excellent corrosion resistance, making them suitable for use in areas with high humidity or exposure to corrosive elements. For example, the superiority of

JSW One TMT

rebars can be attributed to their comprehensive engineering and adherence to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) specifications. Unlike the numerous TMT bars available, which often fail to meet quality standards and are unsafe for construction,

JSW One TMT rebars

stand out for their exceptional quality and performance.

TMX bars

TMX bars offer good strength.

They undergo a more rigorous thermo-mechanical treatment process, improving mechanical properties such as high yield and tensile strength.

Like

TMT

, TMX bars are often used in high-rise buildings, bridges, and other critical structures requiring strength and performance.

HYSD bars

HYSD bars are another type of steel produced by subjecting mild steel to hot or cold working processes followed by quenching and tempering.

They have a good yield strength than conventional mild steel bars, making them suitable for structural applications requiring higher load-bearing capacity.

HYSD bars, including beams, columns, slabs, and foundations, are commonly used in reinforced concrete construction.

Understanding the differences between these materials is crucial in construction and engineering for several reasons

Structural integrity: each steel bar type has different mechanical properties, including yield strength, tensile strength, and ductility. Choosing the right steel bar type ensures the construction project's integrity and safety.

Cost-effectiveness: Selecting the appropriate steel bar type based on the project's requirements can help optimise material usage and reduce costs without compromising structural performance.

Durability and performance: different construction environments and applications demand varying levels of durability and performance. Understanding the properties of TMT, TMX, and HYSD bars enables engineers to select the most suitable material for the intended application, considering factors such as corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, and seismic performance.

TMT bars offer several strengths and advantages in construction

Stronger external layer: TMT bars boast a robust external layer owing to their ductile microstructure and hard crystalline surface, surpassing the strength of HYSD steel bars.

Reduced residual stresses and higher tensile strength: TMT bars exhibit lower residual stresses and higher tensile strength due to their manufacturing process, which doesn't involve physical deformation like HYSD bars.

Eliminating torsional stress: unlike HYSD bars, TMT bars avoid torsional stress during production, minimising surface defects and enhancing structural integrity.

Enhanced corrosion resistance: with fewer surface defects, TMT bars are less susceptible to oxidation and corrosion, ensuring longevity and durability in various environmental conditions.

Cost-effectiveness: TMT bars require no explicit hardening, as their hardening occurs naturally during the water quenching process, reducing energy and expenditure associated with physical deformation. JSW One TMT bars also offer higher structural strength due to their superior chemistry and manufacturing process. This results in fewer bars for the same structural integrity, directly reducing the steel needed for a project.

Versatility and durability: TMT bars exhibit remarkable flexibility and durability, making them suitable for a wide range of construction applications, a primary reason why construction workers prefer them over HYSD bars. The JSW One TMT bars enable the design of structures with narrower columns and reduced concrete volume due to their efficient load transfer.

Reduced steel consumption: utilising TMT bars in construction can decrease steel consumption from 8% to 11% compared to HYSD bars, further enhancing affordability and resource efficiency.

Optimal strength and ductility: TMT bars feature a uniform and hardened periphery and a softer core, ensuring desired tensile strength, high elongation, and ductility, crucial for construction in seismic-prone areas.

Prolonged structural lifespan: TMT bars contribute to longer structural lifespans by resisting rust formation. Unlike HYSD bars, TMT steel inside concrete doesn't react with moisture, preventing rust-induced cracks and preserving structural integrity over time.

In summary, understanding the differences between TMT, TMX, and HYSD bars is essential for engineers and construction professionals to make informed decisions regarding material selection, ensuring structural safety, durability, and compliance with industry standards."

Read more in our latest blog!",Business,3 minutes,tmt-bars-in-residential-construction,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"TMT (thermo-mechanically treated) bars

are critical in residential construction due to their superior strength, durability, and flexibility. These bars primarily reinforce concrete and enhance buildings' structural integrity. Here's a detailed look at the role and benefits of TMT bars in residential construction:

What are TMT bars?

TMT bars

are high-strength reinforcement bars with a rigid outer layer and soft inner core. The manufacturing process involves:

Thermo-mechanical treatment: this process combines mechanical deformation and thermal processing to improve the properties of the steel.

Quenching: right after rolling, a red hot steel bar is passed through a rapid water-cooling system to enhance the strength of the outer layer while the core remains softer. This cooling happens very fast, so the outside becomes hard while the inside remains hot. The quick cooling forms a hard layer called martensite outside the bar.

Self-tempering: the bar's inside, which is still hot, cools down slowly. As it cools, the inside changes into different types of steel phase mixtures called ferrite and perlite, which are not as hard as martensite but are more flexible.

Self-Tempering: The heat from the inside of the bar moves outwards, making the hard outer layer even more challenging with improved ductility and free from residual stress.

Atmospheric cooling: final cooling at room temperature retains the core's ductility and flexibility.

Benefits of using TMT bars in residential construction

High strength: TMT bars, like

JSW One TMT

and

Kalika Fe550 TMT Rebar

, have high tensile strength, essential for building stability. They can withstand substantial loads without failure. The mechanical strength of TMT bars is achieved through a controlled process of rapid quenching and tempering, which forms a combination of the hard martensitic layer with a soft, ductile ferrite-pearlite core, resulting in a product that can sustain heavy loads over extended periods without deformation or failure. 

Ductility: the soft core of TMT bars allows for greater flexibility, reducing the risk of sudden failure during seismic activity. The bars absorb and dissipate energy during an earthquake, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic structural failures. Corrosion resistance: the manufacturing process imparts a high degree of corrosion resistance, ensuring longevity even in humid or saline environments. 

Bonding with concrete: The perfectly shaped ribs on TMT bars provide a better grip on concrete. This enhanced bonding ensures efficient load transfer between the concrete matrix and the steel reinforcement, essential for the composite action in reinforced concrete structures. The improved adhesion minimises slippage. 

Fire resistance: TMT bars can withstand high temperatures, making them more fire-resistant than conventional steel bars. The high thermal stability of TMT bars ensures that they retain their strength and structural integrity for a longer time. 

Cost-effective: despite their superior qualities, TMT bars are cost-effective due to reduced steel consumption, as they are more robust and durable.

Applications in residential construction

Foundation: TMT bars ensure a strong base that can support the weight of the entire structure.

Columns and beams are critical components in residential buildings, providing vertical and horizontal support. TMT bars enhance their load-bearing capacity.

Slabs: reinforcing slabs with

TMT steel

help distribute loads evenly and prevent cracks and other structural issues.

Walls: in load-bearing walls, TMT bars provide additional strength and stability.

Selection criteria for TMT bars

When choosing TMT bars for residential construction, consider the following: 

Grade:

TMT rebars

come in different grades, such as FE 415, FE 500,

FE 550

, etc., indicating their minimum yield strength. Higher grades are used for high-rise buildings. 

Certification: ensure the bars meet relevant industry standards (e.g., ISI certification in India). 

Manufacturer reputation: opt for well-known brands that ensure product quality and consistency. On our website, you will get equality materials from verified sellers.  

TMT steel are integral to modern residential construction, offering a blend of strength, durability, and flexibility that enhances building safety and longevity. Their advantages regarding resistance to natural elements and structural stability make them the preferred choice for reinforcing concrete structures. When planning a residential project, incorporating high-quality

TMT rebars

Installation techniques and best practices:

Site assessment and planning:

Before installation, you will need to conduct a thorough site assessment to determine the most suitable locations for the barriers.

Identify potential hazards, such as sharp curves, steep slopes, bridges, or areas with high traffic volume.

Plan the layout of the barriers to provide maximum protection while allowing for easy access and visibility.

Compliance with regulations:

Ensure compliance with local regulations, standards, and guidelines for barrier installation, such as those set by transportation departments or safety agencies.

Follow manufacturer specifications and recommendations for proper installation techniques.

Proper foundation preparation:

Prepare the foundation according to engineering specifications provided by the manufacturer.

Ensure the ground is levelled and compacted to provide a stable barrier base.

You can use appropriate materials to backfill around the posts to prevent shifting or settling.

Correct installation techniques:

Heavy machinery, such as cranes or forklifts, handles and positions the barriers safely.

Please install the barriers at the recommended height and distance from the edge of the roadway to effectively keep vehicles in case of a crash.

Secure the barriers to their posts using appropriate fasteners or bolts to withstand impact forces.

Maintain proper alignment:

Maintain proper alignment of the barriers to ensure continuous protection along the length of the roadway.

Use string lines or laser levels during installation to achieve straight and consistent alignment.

Regular inspection and maintenance:

Repair or replace damaged barriers promptly to maintain their effectiveness.

Clear vegetation and debris around the barriers to ensure visibility and prevent obstruction.

Safety precautions:

Implement safety measures during installation, such as using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and following safety protocols.

Provide adequate signage and traffic control measures to alert motorists to construction activities.

Documentation and record-keeping:
Keep detailed records of the installation process, including site assessments, engineering plans, and inspection reports.

Document any modifications or repairs made to the barriers for future reference.

By following these installation techniques and best practices, you can ensure that

HR steel

crash barriers are installed effectively and enhance road safety for motorists and pedestrians. Contrary to common belief, crash barriers are intentionally designed to deform upon impact rather than remain rigid. This deliberate deformation serves several purposes: first, it mitigates the g-force experienced by the occupants of a vehicle by preventing an abrupt halt upon collision. Secondly, it disperses the energy generated by the impact across multiple sections of the barrier, thereby reducing the strain on any single point of contact. Additionally, this design minimises the risk of sharp metal sections breaking off and becoming hazardous projectiles. However, the effectiveness of these barriers hinges on various factors, including the type of vehicle, its velocity, and its mass, all of which contribute to the force exerted upon impact."

Components like sand, gravel, crushed stone, and water are essential for the final product.

Concrete: more than just cement and water

While cement is the binding agent in concrete, aggregates like sand, stone, and gravel comprise approximately 75% of its composition. Concrete gains its characteristic strength and durability through hydration—a chemical reaction between cement and water. Understanding the role of aggregates in concrete is paramount, as varying their proportions can significantly affect the material's properties, ensuring the creation of solid and durable structures.

Cement vs concrete: why the distinction is important

Recognising the distinction between cement and concrete is crucial, as these terms are often interchangeable. Cement is one ingredient in the concrete mix, with aggregates and water playing equally vital roles. This understanding facilitates informed decision-making in construction projects, fostering innovation and advancements in the field.

Building better structures: choosing the right mix of cement and concrete

Appropriate

cement

and concrete mix is paramount for constructing robust and durable structures. The proportioning of these ingredients dictates the strength and longevity of the resulting material. Factors such as intended use, environmental conditions, and specific materials must be considered when determining the ideal mix for a project.

Typical applications of cement and concrete

Concrete's versatility and strength render it indispensable in numerous construction applications worldwide. From residential buildings to infrastructure projects like bridges and highways, cement and concrete play pivotal roles in modern construction.

E350A, a grade specified in this standard, has become a popular choice for various applications due to its excellent properties and versatility. E350A (sub-quality A) is a quality of steel where the impact test is not required. The impact test is a measure of the toughness of the steel and is performed to ensure that the steel can withstand sudden shock or impact without fracturing or breaking. This test, also known as the Charpy test, involves striking a notched specimen with a pendulum and measuring the energy absorbed by the specimen.

According to IS 2062, the sub-quality A has both killed and semi-killed steel. In killed steel, the molten metal is treated with a strong deoxidising agent, usually silicon, aluminium, before casting. This deoxidation process removes most of the dissolved oxygen and other impurities in the molten metal, ensuring a more uniform and fine-grained structure in the final product. Semi-killed steel undergoes a partial deoxidation process before casting. In this case, the deoxidising agents are added in a controlled manner, but not to the extent of fully removing all the dissolved oxygen. Interested in learning more about steel grades?

In this blog, we will delve into

the world of cold rolling steel

, its significance, and the benefits it offers.

What is cold rolling?

Cold rolling is a manufacturing process employed to shape and enhance the properties of  steel sheets and coils. Unlike hot rolling, which involves heating the metal to high temperatures before passing it through rollers, cold rolling is performed at room temperature or slightly below the recrystallisation temperature. This process of compression and elongation refines the material's structure and yields a wide range of benefits, making it an indispensable technique in the steel industry.

A cold rolling mill is a specialised machine used in the metalworking industry to process and shape metal sheets or strips through the cold rolling process. Cold rolling involves passing the material between a series of rollers to achieve the desired thickness reduction, improved surface finish, and enhanced mechanical properties. Here’s how a cold rolling mill works:

Material loading:
The process begins by loading the material on the entry side of the cold rolling mill. The material may have undergone prior processing steps like hot rolling and preparing it for cold rolling.

Feeding and tensioning:
The material is then fed through the cold rolling mill's entry section. To ensure smooth and continuous processing, the material is tightly tensioned between the entry and exit sections of the mill. Don't miss out on expert insights—

register to stay informed

.

Rolling process:
As the material passes through the cold rolling mill, it goes through a series of rollers that gradually reduce its thickness. The rollers are set at specific gaps or clearances, which determine the degree of reduction achieved at each stage. Temperature ranges typically from 60 degrees celsius  to 180 degrees celsius  and the desired reduction in thickness of the material is from 6 mm to 0.06 mm.

Reversing mill (optional):
In some cold rolling mills, particularly for thinner materials, a reversing mill arrangement is used. This means the material is rolled back and forth in the  main rolling mill to achieve the desired thickness reduction.

Tandem mill:
The tandem rolling mill consists of multiple stands, through which the work material passes continually. The thickness of the work strip is reduced by a certain amount at each stand, resulting in a significant total reduction between the first and last stand.

Annealing (optional):
For certain materials and applications, intermediate annealing (also known as process annealing) may be performed between rolling passes. This

annealing process

helps relieve internal stresses and improves the material's ductility, allowing for further reduction without the risk of cracking. This process is performed from 260 degrees celsius (500 degrees fahrenheit) to 760 degrees celsius (1400 degrees fahrenheit). 

Skin passing (temper rolling) (optional):
After the primary cold rolling, the material may undergo skin passing or temper rolling. This is a light cold rolling process applied to improve the surface finish and prolong the ageing behaviour especially in low carbon steel grades.

Exit section and coiling line:
Once the desired thickness and properties are achieved, the cold-rolled material exits the mill. It may be coiled into rolls or cut into sheets, depending on the application and customer requirements.

What is the purpose behind applying the close annealing process to Cold Rolled Close Annealed (CRCA) material?

The close annealing procedure involves subjecting cold rolled steel to high temperatures, just below 720 degrees celsius while preventing the steel coil from coming in contact with oxygen to avoid oxidation. This operation, spanning a duration of 2 to 3 days, often takes place within a bell furnace. Through close annealing, the lamellar pearlite structure undergoes a transformation into spheroidal cementite, leading to a significant improvement in ductility. 

Ductility is an essential characteristic of steel, allowing it to undergo processes like drawing. The drawing process is classified into different grades such as simple drawing, deep drawing, extra deep drawing, and non-aging extra deep drawing quality grades.

Different grades of cold rolled steel

There are different grades that refer to the quality and suitability of the cold-rolled steel for various applications. Join our community to learn more—

!

CR1 - Commercial Quality (CQ) or Ordinary (O) Grade: This grade represents a basic quality level suitable for general commercial applications where surface smoothness and finish are not critical factors. CR1 has 0.15% of carbon - it is harder than rest of the grades and less formable. It might be used in applications that do not require intricate forming or deep drawing.

CR2 - Drawing Quality (D) Grade: CR2 has 0.08% of carbon. This grade offers improved surface finish and formability compared to CR1. It is suitable for applications that involve moderate forming or drawing processes, such as appliances, and general engineering components.

CR3 - Deep Drawing Quality (DD) Grade: CR3 has 0.02% carbon. It is specifically designed for deep drawing applications. Deep drawing involves forming a sheet into three-dimensional shapes like kitchen utensils, automotive components, and certain containers.

CR4 - Extra Deep Drawing Quality (EDD) Grade: CR4 has 0.015% of carbon. It is intended for applications requiring intricate and complex deep drawing processes. EDD steel can be door inners, dash panels and bodyside inners.

Advantages of cold rolling steel

Enhanced surface finish: Cold rolling refines the surface of  steel, creating a smoother and more polished appearance. This is especially significant for applications where aesthetics play a crucial role, such as in decorative items and architectural elements.

Precise dimensional control: Cold rolling allows for tight regulation of steel's thickness and width. This precision is essential in industries with stringent tolerance requirements, like the automotive and aerospace sectors.

Improved mechanical properties: The cold rolling process enhances the hardness and strength of  steel while preserving its ductility. This makes the material more suitable for applications that demand durability and resistance to wear.

Stress and grain refinement:

Cold rolling

reduces internal stresses and refines the grain structure of steel. As a result, the material exhibits improved mechanical properties and increased resistance to corrosion and cracking.

Conclusion

Cold rolling is a fundamental process that shapes  steel into

sheets and coils

with remarkable precision, improved mechanical properties, and a flawless surface finish. Its wide array of benefits makes it an essential technique in various industries where  steel is used. From enhancing surface aesthetics to providing high strength and durability, cold rolling plays a crucial role in the production of  steel products we encounter in our daily lives."
466cLD4kx2VCUm6gXJiVVv,Understanding Mild steel : A technical guide,What are the Types of Mild Steel | JSW One MSME Blog,"Mild Steel is crucial for many industries worldwide. Read our blog to know the types of mild steel, their advantages, and disadvantages",Product,3 Mins,understanding-mild-steel-a-technical-guide,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Mild steel is low-carbon steel made from iron and carbon. It is an inexpensive steel category with properties suitable for most general engineering applications. Due to its high iron content, mild steel has excellent magnetic properties; it is therefore defined as being 'ferromagnetic'.

The carbon content in mild steel ranges between 0.16% and 0.29 % and has a relatively higher melting point between 1450°C to 1520°C. This melting point means that

mild steel

is more ductile when heated, making it especially suitable for drilling, cutting, forging, and welding, thus easy to fabricate.

to ensure you get the best mild steel for all your fabrication requirements.

However, mild steel is not that suitable for hardening. Only in some instances can it be hardened by heating it, adding a chemically reactive carbon source to it, and the subsequent quench cycle will harden the surface layer.

Mild steel does not have good corrosion resistance in an untreated form, which, however, can be improved to a significant extent by applying an appropriate surface protection product to the exposed parts of the project. Several options are available in the market to enhance the appearance of mild steel and protect it from rust and corrosion, like red oxide primers, metal paint, metal spray paint, and zinc treatments.

This category of steel is graded as per its chemical composition, the way it is produced, and its properties, so you will have many options of mild steel to choose from basis your requirements. This article will discuss the three most widely used types of Mild steel.

1. Carbon steel -

Carbon steel is the most commonly used type of mild steel, given its high strength-to-weight ratio. Carbon steel is divided into four types based on the amount of carbon content present in it:

· Class C (0.3% or less)

· Class M (0.3% – 0.6%)

· Class S (0.6% – 1%)

· Class P (1%-1.5%).

Class C is used for most applications because it provides high tensile strength. However, class C carbon steel can be susceptible to corrosion when exposed to moisture for an extended duration without proper protection.

2. High-Strength Low Alloy Steel -

Compared to normal carbon steel, high-strength low alloy (HSLA) steel delivers more strength without compromising ductility, weldability, or toughness. Due to its resistance to corrosion, fatigue cracking, and heat damage, HSLA is frequently utilised in applications where durability is crucial, such as bridge construction or military equipment. Due to its lower carbon content than other steels, HSLA is also less expensive than other varieties of mild steel, enabling more effective production methods.

3.

Alloyed Mild Steel -

Alloyed mild steel contains additional elements such as manganese and silicon, which enhance its strength while maintaining malleability and ductility properties similar to those found in regular carbon steels. Alloyed mild steels are particularly popular with manufacturers because they provide an inexpensive way to strengthen parts while retaining their resilience under loads compared to harder alloys such as aluminum or stainless steel.

Advantages of Mild Steel

Cost – Both

hot-rolled

and

cold-rolled

mild steels are cost-effective for many applications.

Range –

Mild steel products

come in vast shapes and sizes, from sheet and plate to bar and sections.

Recyclable – Mild steel can be effectively melted down to be recycled and reused.

Weldable – Mild steel is super easy to weld

Ductile – Mild steel is ideal for deep-drawing procedures because it can be stretched and shaped easily

Disadvantages of Mild Steel

Mild steel has poor corrosion resistance, which is its principal drawback. It, therefore, requires an additional finishing procedure to increase its longevity and offer long-term protection.

Due to its low carbon content and low tensile strength, it is unsuitable for load-bearing applications, such as buildings or other civil engineering projects.

How to finish mild steel fabrications

Since mild steel has low corrosion resistance, it needs to undergo a final finishing process to give the finished product long-term protection and longevity. The most typical finishing procedures are:

• Powder Coating:

The steel's surface is covered with a dry powder, which is then baked on. This results in a tough, long-lasting finish impervious to mechanical and chemical harm.

•

Wet Painting:

To shield the steel from the weather, a coat of paint is given to the surface.

•

Hot dip galvanising

involves dipping the steel in molten zinc and letting it cool. This creates a shield of defence against corrosion and rust.

Many other finishes can be used, but these are the most common.

Summary

Due to its adaptability and affordability, mild steel plays a crucial role in many industries worldwide. Depending on your requirements, various types of Mild steel are available, including carbon steels, HSLA steels, and mild alloyed steels, each of which has its advantages over materials like stainless steel or aluminium alloys. Regardless of the type of steel you select, you need to ensure that you get a high-quality product that will last for years.

that is not only strong but also lightweight and weldable. HSLA steel is used in chassis components, body-in-white, seating components, and suspension assemblies.

Double cradle frame:

This type of frame is also widely used in India. It has two tubes that support the engine, offering greater strength and rigidity, but the added weight makes it less optimal for performance-oriented motorcycles. It is commonly used in touring and long-distance bikes.

The two most popular types of steel used in the double-cage frame are:

High-alloy steel:

This type of steel is known for its high strength and excellent corrosion & fatigue resistance

Galvanised steel

:

This type of steel is well known for its corrosion resistance, making it ideal for motorcycles that will be exposed to rain or snow regularly.

Perimeter frame:

The perimeter frame, also known as the twin-spar frame, is less rigid than the other types of motorcycle chassis, making it a popular choice for high-performance sports bikes.

Perimeter frames are manufactured using a combination of

carbon steel

,

high-strength steel (HSS)

, and various

alloy steels

(titanium, magnesium HSS alloys) depending on factors such as cost and the weight of the bike.

When weight is not a concern,

stainless steel

and its alloys are employed as they are corrosion-resistant, hard, durable, and ductile. SS can be machined to very high levels of precision, making it a practical and cost-effective option for fine detailing work on sports bikes.

Monocoque frame:

The monocoque frame is built with a single metal piece (hence the name). Though typically used in cars, monocoque chassis is used in the manufacture of certain types of motorcycles. In a monocoque, the entire skeletal structure is produced from a single sheet of steel or other material, using robotics.

Modern two-wheeler monocoque designs employ a combination of steel and carbon fibre or alloyed steel aluminum. Steels used in monocoque production include -

High-strength low alloy steel (HSLA)

High-tensile strength steel (HTST)

Carbon steel

Alloy steel

Trellis frame:

Known for its simple construction, and lightweight strength, the trellis frame is another popular type of chassis in motorcycle manufacturing. The biggest advantage of using a trellis frame is its lightweight construction.

The main material used for manufacturing trellis frames is mild steel, which is made up of iron and carbon. Furthermore, steel alloys such as

chromium steel alloy, and stainless steel

are also used to complement the central steel structure.

As we can see, over a dozen varieties of steel and steel alloys are used in the construction of a two-wheeler chassis. Here’s a quick look at the 5 most popular ones -

Stainless steel

–

Due to its lightweight nature, corrosion resistance, high tensile strength, and resistance to wear and tear, stainless steel can endure heavy loads without breaking. This makes it a good choice for the production of robust, durable motorcycle components.

Advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) –

These materials offer exceptionally low weight, high strength, and optimised formability, allowing manufacturers to utilise less material and significantly lowering a vehicle's weight. Their tensile strengths are higher than those of traditional high-strength steel. Nearly all new motorcycle designs now use AHSS.

Low-carbon, or mild steel –

It is the most frequently used metal in the manufacture of commuter motorcycles because it has lower production costs and greater durability than other easily available forms of steel. Except

for high-per

formance sports bikes, all two-wheelers utilise mild steel to varying extents depending upon weight, chassis type, and overall design.

Galvanised steel

–

Galvanised steel is less expensive than stainless steel but more efficient than aluminum. It’s the perfect alternative to high-carbon and AHSS steel grades that provide long-lasting protection for every component of the vehicle they are utilised in.

The lower cost, enhanced durability, good surface finish, and availability of galvanised steel are a few of its advantages.

hot-rolled steel wire rods

for general engineering purposes. SAE stands for Society of Automotive Engineers. These are American standard steel grades designated by the SAE-AISI system. These wires are used in the manufacturing of nails, screws, wire mesh, wire ropes, and other wire-based items. They are known for their excellent surface finish, which makes them suitable for applications where appearance is essential. They offer excellent formability, drawability, and weldability and are widely used. These rods have excellent corrosion resistance and are highly durable. They are commonly treated using wire drawing processes to produce different wires.

Factors to consider when wire rod drawing to make fasteners

Material selection: the choice of material for the

wire rods

is crucial. Common materials include carbon steel and various alloys. Each material has different properties, such as strength, corrosion resistance, upsettability (a measure of the ductility) and cost, which should be considered based on the intended application.

Wire diameter: the diameter of the wire rods determines the size of the nails or screws produced. It's essential to select the appropriate diameter based on the desired strength and functionality of the fastener.

Wire quality: the quality of the wire rods directly affects the quality of the nails and screws. Factors such as tensile strength, surface finish, upsettability (a measure of the ductility) and uniformity of the wire should be considered to ensure consistent performance and durability.

Manufacturing process: various manufacturing processes can be used to fabricate nails and

screws from wire rods

like cold heading (a length of wire is inserted into a die and then struck with a punch at high speed and pressure), thread rolling (produces threads on cylindrical parts such as bolts, screws, etc.), and heat treatment. The choice of process depends on factors such as the fasteners' desired shape, size, and properties.

Surface treatment: surface treatment, such as galvanising or coating, can enhance the corrosion resistance and appearance of the nails and screws. The appropriate surface treatment should be selected based on the environmental conditions and the intended use of the fasteners.

Quality control: rigorous quality control measures should be implemented throughout the fabrication process to ensure that the nails and screws meet the required specifications and standards. This includes monitoring dimensional accuracy, mechanical properties, and surface finish.

Key performance indicators

Tensile Strength measures the maximum stress a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before breaking. For steel wire rods like SAE1008, SAE1018, and SAE1006, typical tensile strengths can vary based on processing, heat treatment, and alloying elements. However, these grades generally exhibit tensile strengths within a specific range. For example:

SAE1008

: Typically has a tensile strength ranging from 340 MPa to 420 MPa.

SAE1018

: Typically has a tensile strength ranging from 440 MPa to 540 MPa.

SAE1006

: Typically has a tensile strength ranging from 290 MPa to 380 MPa.

Durability refers to the ability of a material to withstand various environmental and mechanical stresses over time without degradation. Steel wire rods like SAE1008, SAE1018, and SAE1006 are known for their durability, making them suitable for various applications.

From corrosion resistance to cost-effectiveness, find out why it's the ideal choice for sustainable energy solutions.",Business,3 minutes,5-advantages-of-galvanised-steel-support-posts-in-solar-projects,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Solar structures are designed to position solar panels at optimal angles and orientations to maximise sunlight exposure throughout the day. This ensures that solar panels can generate the maximum amount of electricity possible, increasing energy production and efficiency. Galvanised steel is highly sought after due to its exceptional durability in solar projects, combining steel's robustness and malleability with the zinc-iron coating's protective properties. For optimal protection, it's recommended to have a zinc coating of at least 10 micrometres on the surface and a total

galvanised layer

of about 80 to 85 micrometres when embedding

steel in concrete

. 

Zinc is usually inactive or doesn't react much when embedded in concrete because the concrete's pH is relatively high (13.5). When the pH of the concrete is a bit lower (but still within a safe range), around 13.3, a protective layer forms on the zinc; this layer prevents further corrosion. During this process, a thin layer of zinc (about 10 micrometres thick) gets used up uniformly. A pure zinc coating provides better protection compared to a zinc-iron alloy coating.

This versatility makes galvanised steel suitable for various agriculture, solar energy, automotive, and construction applications. Below, we'd like to offer an in-depth overview of the galvanisation process, its diverse methods, benefits, and use in various sectors.

The galvanisation process unfolds in the following steps:

Degreasing: the steel undergoes cleaning in a degreasing solution.

Pickling: the steel is immersed in diluted hot sulfuric acid to remove impurities.

Fluxing: the steel is treated in an aqueous solution, typically zinc-ammonium chloride, to prepare its surface for galvanisation.

Galvanisation: the steel is then immersed in a vat of molten zinc to apply the protective coating.

Inspection: finally, the coated steel undergoes thorough examination to ensure uniformity and complete coverage.

Using galvanised steel support posts in solar projects offers several advantages:

1. Corrosion resistance:

Galvanised steel's sacrificial anode mechanism protects exposed or damaged areas. Regardless of how much of the steel is uncovered, the zinc coating will corrode before the steel does. This sacrificial corrosion acts as a shield, safeguarding vulnerable sections of the steel support posts.

2. Strength and durability:

galvanised steel support

posts have high tensile strength and can withstand heavy loads, such as solar panels and mounting structures. This strength and durability make them reliable for supporting the weight of the solar array over its operational lifespan.

3. Cost-effectiveness:

while initial costs may be slightly higher compared to other materials, galvanised steel support posts offer significant cost savings over the long term due to their durability and low maintenance requirements. Their corrosion resistance reduces the need for frequent inspections and replacements, resulting in lower overall project expenses.

4. Tolerates higher chloride migration:

Galvanised steel demonstrates a superior capacity to withstand elevated levels of chloride migration compared to its uncoated counterpart. Chloride migration refers to the movement of chloride ions through a material, which can accelerate corrosion. Zinc has a higher standard electrode potential than steel, which is more likely to corrode sacrificially in corrosive elements like chloride ions.

5.

Environmental sustainability:

galvanised steel

is a highly recyclable material, making it an environmentally sustainable choice for solar projects. The steel can be recycled and repurposed at the end of its lifespan, reducing the project's environmental impact and contributing to circular economy practices. This aligns with the sustainability goals of many solar energy initiatives.

Galvanised steel components

are typically lightweight and easy to handle, facilitating the installation process of solar structures. Their standardised sizes and shapes also simplify construction, saving time and labour costs during installation."

.

When used correctly, it can also prevent the formation of cracks and increase the overall lifespan of the structure. However, using rebar in concrete footings requires careful planning and attention to detail to ensure it is installed correctly and at the appropriate depth.

This guide will provide you with all the essential information you need to know about using

rebar

in concrete footings, including its benefits, types, placement, and installation procedures.

Why use rebars in concrete footings?

Using rebar for concrete footings is essential for several reasons:

1. Increased strength –

Including rebar in concrete footings imparts tensile strength to the structure, enabling it to resist cracking and breakage caused by the weight of the superstructure and the settling of the ground. This extra reinforcement enhances the footings' ability to support the load and maintain stability over an extended period.

2. Improved load distribution -

The use of rebar in concrete footings promotes uniform load distribution by evenly distributing the structure's weight across the footing. This even load distribution minimises the likelihood of uneven settlement and potential structural damage. This load distribution is especially crucial in regions with variable soil conditions or where the footing is under heavy or concentrated loads.

3. Crack control -

Concrete is resilient in compression but vulnerable to tension. Hence, it is prone to cracking when subjected to tensile stresses such as ground movement, temperature changes, or shrinkage during curing. Incorporating rebar in the concrete reinforces it, providing tensile strength and controlling and reducing the size and frequency of cracks that may occur in the footing.

4. Enhanced structural integrity -

Including rebar in footings links them to the rest of the building, such as columns, walls, or slabs, creating a harmonious and unified system that collaboratively supports the structure. This connection enhances the overall structural integrity and stability of the building.

Types of Rebars

1. Steel rebar:

Steel rebar is the most commonly used type in construction. It is made of carbon steel and has excellent strength and durability. Steel rebar is available in different grades and sizes to meet construction requirements. It is suitable for all construction projects, including high-rise buildings, bridges, and highways.

2. Fibreglass rebar:

Fibreglass rebar is a lightweight and corrosion-resistant alternative to steel rebar. It is made of glass fibres and a polymer resin matrix, which makes it ideal for use in environments with high moisture or chemical exposure. Fibreglass rebar is non-conductive, making it an ideal choice for structures that require electrical isolation. It is also easy to handle and install, and its lightweight properties make it easier to transport and manoeuvre.

3. Stainless steel rebar:

Stainless steel rebar is a more expensive option than steel rebar but offers exceptional corrosion resistance. It is made of steel and chromium, creating a passive oxide layer that protects the rebar from corrosion. Stainless steel rebar is ideal for structures exposed to corrosive elements such as seawater, deicing salts, and acidic environments.

4. Galvanised rebar:

Galvanised rebar is a steel rebar with a protective zinc coating. The zinc coating provides a barrier that resists corrosion better than uncoated steel. Galvanised rebar is ideal for use in concrete structures that are exposed to corrosive elements such as salt, chemicals, and moisture.

5. Epoxy-coated rebar:

Epoxy-coated rebar features a protective epoxy coating that prevents rusting. The epoxy coating provides a barrier that resists corrosion and protects the rebar from the effects of concrete alkalinity. Epoxy-coated rebar is ideal for use in concrete structures that are exposed to corrosive elements such as salt, chemicals, and moisture.

Rebar sizes and grades

1.Size -

Rebar is available in various sizes and grades to meet construction needs. The sizes of rebar range from 3-10 mm, and are chosen based on the size and load capacity of the footing.

2. Length -

Rebar bars commonly come in lengths of 12mm.

3. Grade -

Rebar grades denote the yield strength of the steel and are typically Fe 500 and Fe550D. The higher the grade, the stronger the rebar. The selection of the appropriate rebar size and grade is essential to ensure that the footing can support the load and remain stable over time.

The appropriate rebar size ensures that the footing can support the weight of the structure above and resist the natural settling of the ground. The size and type of rebar utilised in concrete slab footings will be based on the project's specific demands, including the slab's dimensions, weight, and local building regulations.

Similarly, the amount of reinforcement used in a slab footing will vary based on factors such as the dimensions of the footing, the spacing between rebars, and the level of reinforcement required. Generally, for a 24"" wide slab footing, two or three rebars are laid in a flat, horizontal position along the entire length of the footing.

Rebar in slab footings is usually arranged systematically, forming a grid-like pattern that includes horizontal and vertical bars crossing at regular intervals. This grid-like pattern is essential for ensuring balanced reinforcement throughout the slab, leading to optimal tensile strength and resistance to cracking.

The main bars or

horizontal rebars

run parallel to the length of the slab, while distribution bars or vertical rebars run perpendicular to the main bars. Adequate support must be provided for the rebars during the concrete pour to maintain correct positioning and ensure proper concrete cover. This support can be in chairs, spacers, or bar supports.

.

Typically supporting axial loads, columns are made for compression. The columns may bend due to additional loads such as snow, wind, or other horizontal forces or thrusts. Columns then need to be designed for axial load and bending. Columns are usually constructed from materials with good compressive strength, like steel, stone, brick, concrete, block, etc.

Types of columns used in construction: -

Based on types of shape

1. Square or rectangular columns

-  These RCC columns are extensively used to construct heavy structures and buildings. Owing to the simplicity of shuttering and supporting it from collapsing due to pressure while the concrete is still in flowable condition, it is easier to manufacture and cast rectangular or square columns than circular ones. The columns are also cost-effective as compared to other columns.

2. Circular columns -

Circular columns are typically utilised in the piling and elevation of buildings for aesthetic purposes. A circular column's bending resistance is often higher than a square or rectangular column since it uses more than four longitudinal steel bars as reinforcement. Round columns are generally utilised as bridge pillars due to good resistance against deflection.

3. L shaped -

These columns are simple to create and cast, and because of the support they offer, they are frequently an excellent option for giant constructions like buildings. The construction workers use these columns to support corner boundary walls.

4. T-shaped -

The T-shaped column is often used as a side column in structures. Based on their shape, T-shape columns are one form of a column. Depending on their design specifications, these columns may be used by construction workers. A T-shape column is the most typical type of column used when building bridges.

5. V-shaped -

This V-shaped column is typically used when the room's shape is still trapezoidal. As compared to the other columns, sufficient amounts of concrete are needed to build this one.

Based on the type of reinforcement

1. Tied columns –

Tied columns are usually built out of reinforced concrete. Longitudinal reinforcements are confined within closely spaced tie reinforcement. Approximately all columns in buildings are tied columns.

2. Spiral columns -

These columns are reinforced with a close and consistent spaced spiral reinforcement. Spiral columns' primary purpose is to support them transversely and keep them from barreling. These columns usually consist of 6 bars as longitudinal reinforcement.

3. Composite columns -

These columns are made of structural steel or cast iron column contained in concrete that has been spirally and longitudinally strengthened. In truss structures, composite columns are frequently utilised to prevent steel from corroding. In addition to having a compact cross-section and greater strength, this kind of column performs well in a fire.

Based on the type of loading

1. Axially loaded RCC column -

A column is axially loaded if vertical axial loads act on the centre of gravity of the cross-section of the column. Axially loaded columns are uncommon in construction because it is impractical to align vertical loads with the centre of gravity of the column section. An example of this kind of column is the interior column of multi-story buildings with symmetrical loads from floor slabs coming from all directions.

2. Uniaxial eccentrically loaded column -

A column is considered uniaxially eccentrically loaded when the axis of vertical loads acts eccentrically on either the X or Y axis of the column cross-section rather than crossing the column's centre of gravity. This loading technique is applied to columns that are rigidly attached to a beam only on one side, such as edge columns.

3. Biaxial eccentrically loaded column -

Biaxial eccentrically loaded columns have vertical loads applied to them that do not align with the centre of gravity of their cross sections and do not act on their X or Y axes. With beams permanently coupled at right angles at the top of columns, biaxially loaded columns are typically employed in corner columns.

Based on Construction material

1. Reinforced concrete column -

Concrete columns with steel reinforcement are reinforced concrete columns. These columns are mostly used in the construction industry. Concrete is robust under compression but fragile under stress. Hence, to boost this tension capacity, structural steel reinforcing is installed.

2. Steel column -

Steel columns

are columns made of

structural steel

. Steel construction is comparatively more robust, flexible, and long-lasting than concrete structures. There are different types of steel columns, but the T-section steel columns are most commonly used in steel structures.

PkoLcQDsDDhABnzH2RUKh,How can you safeguard steel mounting frames against wind to ensure stability?,Safeguarding Steel Mounting Frames Against Wind | JSW One MSME Blog,"Our latest blog unveils the strategies for safeguarding your solar panels against wind damage. From structural analysis to anchoring techniques, learn how steel frames provide the ultimate defense for your renewable energy investment.",Product,3 minutes,how-can-you-safeguard-steel-mounting-frames-against-wind-to-ensure-stability,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Galvanised and galvalume steel are popular options for constructing solar panel frames due to their durability, strength and resistance to corrosion.

Galvanised steel

has a protective zinc coating, while

galvalume steel

is coated with a zinc-aluminium alloy, providing excellent protection against rust and corrosion. This makes them ideal for outdoor applications such as solar panels exposed to various weather conditions throughout their lifetime.

Safeguarding steel mounting frames against wind is essential for these reasons

Structural integrity: wind can exert significant forces on solar panel installations, especially in areas prone to high winds or gusts. The mounting frames could only succeed with proper reinforcement and anchoring, leading to structural damage or collapse.

Protection of solar panels: the mounting frames support the solar panels, so ensuring their stability helps protect the panels themselves. If the frames fail due to wind, it could damage the panels, reducing their efficiency or rendering them inoperable.

Safety: a failure of the mounting frames due to wind could pose safety hazards to nearby structures, people, or property. Properly secured frames minimise the risk of accidents or injuries caused by falling panels or structures.

Longevity of the installation: by safeguarding against the wind, the mounting frames can maintain their structural integrity over time, prolonging the lifespan of the entire solar panel system. This ensures that the investment in renewable energy remains viable and continues to provide benefits over the long term.

Solar steel frames fabricated from steel undergo the following steps

Material selection:

high-quality galvanised

or

galvalume steel

coils are chosen as the starting material. These coils are typically sourced from steel manufacturers and suppliers.

Cutting: the

steel coils

are uncoiled and then cut into the required lengths and widths using shearing machines or laser cutting equipment. Precise measurements are essential to ensure consistency and accuracy in the fabrication process.

Punching and drilling: holes for bolts, fasteners, and other assembly components are punched or drilled into the steel pieces. This step is critical for attaching the frames to support structures and mounting the solar panels later.

Bending and forming: hydraulic or mechanical presses bend and form the steel pieces into the desired shapes and angles for the solar panel frames. This step involves careful manipulation of the steel to achieve the required structural integrity and dimensional accuracy.

Welding: in some cases, welding is used to join multiple

steel components

, especially for larger or more complex frame structures. Welding ensures solid and durable connections between the frame elements.

Surface treatment: after fabrication, the steel frames may undergo additional surface treatments to enhance their corrosion resistance and durability. This could include applying protective coatings or treatments to safeguard the frames against environmental factors further.

Design considerations to ensure wind resistance

Calculate wind loads: determine wind pressure and other factors based on local data and building codes to find the loads on the structure.

Select structure and layout: choose a sturdy structural form like frame-supported or cylinder structures. Arrange components to distribute stress evenly and avoid weak points.

Design components and nodes: size components to handle wind loads. Focus on crucial nodes like

steel beam

and

Explore how steel transforms every aspect of the railway experience.",Business,3 minutes,how-does-steel-in-rail-infrastructure-enhance-the-strength-of-tracks,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Indian Railways is not just a mode of transportation; it has been constantly evolving to cater to the needs of its passengers and tourists. It is recognised as one of the largest railway networks in the world, with a length of over 119,630 kilometres. In rail production, the steel grades used are specifically chosen for their durability, resistance to wear, and ability to withstand heavy loads and environmental conditions. Here are some common steel grades and their typical compositions used in manufacturing rails:

Carbon-manganese steels are the most

common steel grades

used in standard rail production. They typically include about 0.6% to 1.2% carbon, which provides hardness, and 0.8% to 1.7% manganese, which improves toughness and wear resistance.

Micro-alloyed steels contain small amounts of alloys like vanadium, niobium, or titanium. For example, a typical composition might include less than 0.1% of each micro-alloy. These elements refine the grain size of the steel by forming alloy carbide precipitations ( to increase hardness and wear resistance) at the grain boundary, enhancing its strength and toughness without needing extensive heat treatments.

Pearlitic steels are named for their microstructure; they contain high carbon and manganese levels, similar to the carbon-manganese steels. Still, they are specifically treated to form a pearlitic microstructure through controlled cooling methods, enhancing strength and wear resistance. They typically contain around 0.7% to 1% carbon and 0.8% to 1.5% manganese.

Heat-treated steels undergo controlled heat treatments after rolling to improve their hardness and stress resistance. Their compositions vary, but they typically have higher carbon content to respond well to heat treatments.

High-silicon steels are used for high-strength applications. These steels contain increased levels of silicon (around 1.0% to 2.0%) to improve elasticity and corrosion resistance, making them suitable for high-speed rail applications.

Chromium-molybdenum steels: adding chromium (up to 1%) and molybdenum (up to 0.2%) to steel increases its hardness and temperature resistance, making these steels ideal for heavy-load bearing rails and those operating under extreme conditions.

Applications

Rail tracks: the rails themselves are typically made of steel. Steel rails are chosen for their high strength, durability, and resistance to wear and tear. They can withstand heavy loads and constant rolling of trains without significant deformation or damage. Most railway tracks nowadays are made from

hot-rolled steel

with a grade of 1084 or higher. 

This type of medium carbon steel is produced by rolling rail steel with natural iron ore. The process creates a mix of steel that contains around 0.7% to 0.8% carbon and 0.7% to 1% manganese. This type of steel can withstand more wear and tear than rolled steel alone.

Rail fasteners: steel fasteners such as bolts, clips, and spikes are used to secure rails to sleepers or ties. These

fasteners

ensure the rails remain firmly in place, even under the dynamic loads passing trains exert.

Rail bridges: many railway bridges are constructed using stainless steel.

Stainless steel

offers a high strength-to-weight ratio, making it an ideal material for building long-span bridges that can support heavy loads, including trains and cargo. Also, ones located in corrosive regions require constant repair and maintenance due to exposure to high salt content in marine environments. To mitigate this risk, stainless steel can be used.

Station structures: steel is often used to construct station buildings, platforms, canopies, and other structures. Steel frames provide strength and stability, allowing for large open spaces and flexible architectural designs.

Overhead catenary systems: in electrified railway systems, steel structures support the overhead wires that provide power to trains. These structures must be strong enough to withstand wind loads and maintain the tension of the overhead wires. Stainless steel catenary wire is created from multiple thin wire strands.

Tunnels: steel is used to construct tunnel linings, ventilation systems, and other components of railway tunnels. Steel reinforcements help to stabilise the tunnel walls and prevent collapse, ensuring the safety of trains passing through. For example, stainless steel was used in the Jammu and Kashmir tunnel project. 

Maintenance equipment: steel is also used to manufacture equipment such as rail grinders (that smooth out rough patches on tracks), track tampers (that ensure the gravel is tightly packed), and ballast regulators (that spread the gravel evenly). These machines help ensure railway tracks' smooth operation and safety by maintaining proper alignment, level, and stability.

There's a focus on material science to develop steel alloys that provide optimal performance under specific conditions. For example, adding aspects like chromium or nickel can enhance corrosion resistance, which is vital for rails in harsh environmental conditions."

Using light steel framing and modular construction has several advantages for thermal performance

Cost-effective high thermal performance: Lightweight construction enables achieving U-values of less than 0.15 W/m^2K without the need for excessively thick walls. U-values are a measure of the rate of heat transfer through a building element, such as a wall, roof, or window. Lower U-values indicate better thermal performance, as less heat is lost through the element.

Airtight construction: In terms of airtightness, the construction can achieve levels below 3 m^3/m^2/h, indicating superior airtightness compared to traditional on-site construction. This is crucial, as lower air leakage rates mean less unwanted heat loss, potentially reducing up to 30% of a building's total heat loss. These benefits position

light steel

framing and modular construction as attractive options for achieving high thermal performance in various building types, including housing, residential buildings, schools, and public sector buildings.

Predictive Y-values: Extensive thermal analysis leads to predictive Y-values of less than 0.08 W/m^2K in building energy models, indicating superior thermal performance. Y-values are used to quantify the heat loss through building elements such as junctions, corners, and connections. Lower Y-values indicate lower heat loss through thermal bridging, which contributes to improved overall thermal performance of the building envelope.

Prevention of overheating: High insulation and low thermal mass prevent excessive overheating, ensuring that heat is not stored over successive hot days.
Responsiveness and reliability: Lightweight systems, being more responsive and reliable due to off-site modular construction, ensure greater reliability of the building fabric.

The thermal performance of steel-framed prefabricated buildings depends on various factors, including the design, insulation, construction materials, and the overall building envelope. Here are some key considerations:

Thermal conductivity of steel: Steel is a good conductor of heat, which means it can conduct and transfer heat relatively easily. This characteristic can influence the overall thermal performance of the building.

Insulation: The insulation material used in the walls, roof, and floor of the prefabricated building plays a crucial role in controlling heat transfer. Common insulation materials include fibreglass, foam board, mineral wool, or spray foam.

Building envelope design: The design of the building envelope, including walls, roof, and floor, is critical for thermal performance. Proper sealing, air barriers, and vapour barriers can help prevent heat loss or gain.

Thermal bridging: Steel has a higher thermal conductivity compared to many insulation materials. This can lead to thermal bridging, where heat bypasses insulation through the steel framing. This issue can be mitigated by using thermal breaks or insulating materials around the

steel framing members

.

Energy efficiency standards: Many regions have energy efficiency standards and codes that dictate the minimum requirements for thermal performance in buildings. Compliance with these standards is essential for ensuring energy-efficient construction.

Cool roof and reflective coatings: For the roof, using cool roofing materials or reflective coatings can help reduce solar heat absorption, thereby improving the building's overall thermal performance.

Climate considerations: The local climate plays a significant role in determining the appropriate level of insulation and other thermal design considerations. Cold climates may require more emphasis on preventing heat loss, while hot climates may focus on reducing heat gain.

Ventilation and HVAC systems: Properly designed and efficient ventilation and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems can contribute to maintaining a comfortable indoor environment with minimal energy consumption.

Thermal mass: The thermal mass of the building materials, including steel, can influence how the building retains and releases heat. Utilising materials with high thermal mass can help stabilise indoor temperatures.

Energy modelling: Energy modelling and simulations can be employed to assess the thermal performance of the building under different conditions. This can help optimise the design for energy efficiency."

6BA5rEfWH4d2c09Nh2xZHK,How steel reinforcements protect passengers in a crash,How Steel Reinforcements Protect Passengers | JSW One MSME Blog,"Explore the critical role of steel reinforcements in vehicle safety over the past six decades. These reinforcements, strategically placed in areas like the frame, pillars, and door beams, absorb impact energy during crashes.",Product,3 minutes,how-steel-reinforcements-protect-passengers-in-a-crash,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Over the last six decades, most mass-produced vehicle bodies were manufactured from stamped steel components.

Steel reinforcements

play a crucial role in protecting passengers during a crash by absorbing impact energy. During a crash, these reinforcements distribute the kinetic energy generated by the collision. By doing so, they reduce the force transferred to the occupants. Steel reinforcements enhance the overall structural strength of the vehicle, maintaining its shape and integrity during a collision. This helps prevent the cabin from collapsing or deforming excessively, thereby protecting the occupants.

A highly malleable steel sheet has been created through a process that involves refining the grain structure of ferrite. This is achieved by subjecting the steel to high-reduction hot rolling at low temperatures, followed by immediate accelerated cooling after the hot rolling phase. Additional steps include high-reduction cold rolling and high-temperature annealing. The resulting steel sheet plays a significant role in reducing production costs by saving on metal die expenses and eliminating the need for joining processes. This is accomplished through the integrated forming of intricate parts.

In vehicles, these reinforcements, often in the form of high-strength steel, are strategically placed in key areas like the frame, pillars, and door beams.

Crumple zones:

steel reinforcements are also designed to create specific crumple zones in a vehicle. These zones, typically at the front and rear, deform in a controlled manner, effectively dissipating the energy of the impact and extending the time of the collision. This gradual deceleration reduces the forces experienced by the passengers inside the cabin. To make car crash protection better, scientists wrap the mild steel parts in a special material called fibre-reinforced composite. They tested two types of this material, carbon/epoxy and e-glass/epoxy, by changing how they wrapped it around metal structures. The goal is to find the most effective combination that maximises the absorption of kinetic energy during a crash, ultimately enhancing the safety of passengers in transportation structures.

Occupant compartment protection:

the reinforcements help in maintaining the integrity of the passenger compartment, preventing intrusion from external objects. This protects the occupants from being directly impacted by objects entering the cabin during a crash.

Door beams:

Door impact beams are reinforcement members installed in car doors to absorb the kinetic energy of a side collision. They are important in cars because they help to reduce damage to passengers in the passenger compartment, therefore reducing the risk of injury and death in side collisions. Steel tubes are increasingly being used in making door impact beams because they offer weight savings over traditional high-strength steel sheets. When making door impact beams, the outside diameter of the tube depends on the space available in the door, and its wall thickness on the necessary bending load and absorbed energy. The deformation behaviour of door impact beams made of steel tubes is divided into three steps: cross-sectional flattening, plastic collapse, and circumferential buckling. Steel tubes capable of absorbing high energy are a better option for making door impact beams because of their lightweight and high strength.

B-pillars:

the B-pillars, located between the front and rear doors on the sides of the vehicle, often contain high-strength steel. They provide structural support and help maintain the integrity of the roof in the event of a rollover or side collision. Hot formed steels are used in various critical automotive components B-pillar reinforcements. In the case of B-pillar reinforcements and similar components, manufacturers employ various strategies:

Welding energy absorbing materials:

High-strength low alloy (HSLA) steels or Advanced High-Strength Steels (AHSS) are welded to provide the necessary energy absorption. Some welding processes can create a heat-affected zone with altered material properties. These minimise the creation of brittle zones that could compromise the material's energy-absorbing characteristics.

Thickness alterations:

The thickness in energy-absorbing areas is often reduced to reinforce them with conventional high-strength or advanced high-strength steels.

Reinforced frame:

the vehicle's frame or chassis is reinforced with high-strength steel, providing the overall structural strength necessary to maintain the vehicle's integrity during various types of crashes. Other parts like cross members are horizontal reinforcements that connect the vehicle's frame or chassis, enhancing overall rigidity and structural integrity.

Roof reinforcements:

steel

reinforcements are integrated into the roof structure to maintain its integrity in the event of a rollover accident, preventing the roof from collapsing and protecting the occupants.

Sill reinforcements:

these reinforcements are along the bottom edge of the vehicle's body. They work in conjunction with other safety features such as airbags, crumple zones, and seatbelt systems. Sill reinforcements add rigidity to the vehicle's chassis and prevent intrusion into the passenger compartment during a side impact."

",Product,3 minutes,role-of-steel-in-enhancing-noise-vibration-and-harshness-nvh-vehicle,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Vehicle Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) refers to the three interrelated aspects that greatly influence the overall driving experience. Noise, vibration, and harshness can be perceived by passengers as annoying, uncomfortable, or even detrimental to their well-being. Addressing NVH challenges is vital for automakers to create vehicles that not only meet performance standards but also deliver a smooth and enjoyable ride.

Steel's contribution to noise reduction

Steel

, known for its strength and durability, acts as an effective barrier against external noise entering the vehicle cabin. By strategically incorporating

steel components

in various vehicle structures, such as the chassis, body panels, and doors, manufacturers can significantly reduce the impact of external sounds, contributing to a quieter and more peaceful driving environment.

There is a special kind of vibration-reducing device called a metal-net isolator. This device is made up of a network of stainless steel and metal wires. When something pushes or pulls on this stainless steel network, the metal wires in it move. This movement creates what is called 'dry friction' – a kind of resistance that helps in soaking up energy.

This soaking up of energy is important because it helps to lessen vibrations. Imagine if you push on a spring; it bounces back. But with the metal-net isolator, when you push on it, it doesn't bounce back as much because it's busy soaking up that push energy. This makes it really good at reducing shakes and trembles, whether they come from the device itself or from outside sources. In simpler terms, this metal-net isolator is like a cushion that absorbs shocks, making things less shaky and more stable.

Advanced high strength steel in NVH components

Weight savings through thinner steel:

Traditional applications of Dual Phase (DP)

hot rolled steel

have focused on large components like frame members due to their good strength-to-weight ratio. A higher strength-to-weight ratio indicates a material that is both strong and lightweight, making it ideal for engineering and construction. However, NVH components, often known for being heavy, because they need to effectively reduce noise and vibration, present a new frontier for weight reduction.

Thinner steel sheets can be employed without compromising the design requirements of NVH components. This not only contributes to a lighter overall vehicle but also holds the potential for cost savings in material usage.

Overcoming secondary forming challenges

Historically, challenges in secondary forming processes have limited the range of parts produced using DP steel. NVH components, with their complex shapes and requirements, have faced similar limitations.
Advances in manufacturing techniques and process optimisation now enable the successful production of intricate NVH components using DP steel - having microstructure of a soft ferrite phase as substrate and a hard martensite phase as dispersed islands.  It's very strong yet still ductile (meaning it can bend without breaking). This breakthrough widens the scope of applications and enhances design flexibility.

Tailored fatigue properties for NVH applications

The fatigue properties of DP steel align well (meaning it can endure stresses of constant loading and unloading) with the demands of NVH components. These parts often experience cyclic loading and dynamic stresses, making fatigue resistance a critical factor in their performance.
DP steel's tailored microstructure and composition offer enhanced fatigue strength, ensuring the longevity and reliability of NVH components under real-world driving conditions.

By integrating these solutions into the design, engineering, and manufacturing processes, automotive manufacturers can achieve a harmonious balance between performance, comfort, and NVH characteristics, ultimately delivering vehicles that meet or exceed customer expectations."

",Product,3 minutes,benefits-of-steel-cladding-sheets-in-construction-projects,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"There are different types of

steel cladding sheets

that are coated with metals like zinc or other alloys, used in construction because of the numerous benefits. Cladding refers to a material or layer that is applied to the exterior of a building or structure to provide protection, insulation, or decorative purposes. These cladding sheets have become an asset in the construction industry, from enhancing structural integrity to providing weather resistance and aesthetic appeal.

How are steel sheets galvanised?

There are two methods for producing

galvanised sheets

:

Hot-dip galvanising:

This is the most common method and involves dipping the steel sheets into a bath of molten zinc. The sheets are then cooled to solidify the zinc coating.

Electroplating:

This process involves passing an electric current through the steel sheets immersed in zinc salts. Here's how it typically occurs:

Steel's potential is around -400 millivolts (mV) compared to a standard reference called the Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE), the benchmark for measuring potentials. This means steel is somewhat anodic and tends to give away electrons, making it react with its surroundings in a certain way.

The potential measures how eager these materials are to give away their electrons. When a material gives away electrons, it becomes 'anodic', making it more willing to interact with other substances.

On the other hand, electroplated zinc, a layer of zinc applied to another material through electroplating, has a potential of around -980 mV when compared to the same SCE reference. The zinc ions are attracted to the steel sheets and form a layer of zinc on the surface.

They are known for providing strength, stability, and support. While

I-beams

come in various materials and fabrication methods,

hot rolled steel

is a popular choice due to its exceptional resilience. When steel beams are made, the way they are shaped by rolling affects how well they can support weight and handle forces. This rolling process changes the beam's shape and structure.

In beams like 'I' beams, which have a vertical part in the middle and horizontal parts at the top and bottom, the horizontal parts are responsible for handling most of the bending forces, while the vertical part mainly deals with the forces that try to shear or cut the beam.

Sometimes, during the rolling process, the shape of the beam changes from a solid, compact form to a thin-walled one with open spaces. This transformation makes the beam less stiff and less resistant to twisting forces.

To figure out how well different beam shapes perform, efficiency ratios are used. These ratios help them understand how the rolling process affects the beam's shape and how that, in turn, affects its strength and performance.

There are specific properties of the beam's shape that are important. These properties include things like how much the beam can bend without breaking, how strong it is when it comes to resisting bending forces, and how well it can resist forces that try to shear or cut it.

In this blog, we'll explore how

hot rolled steel

contributes to the resilience of I-beams.

The basics of I-beams

I-beams, also known as H-beams or W-beams, have a distinctive 'I' shape when viewed in cross-section. This shape consists of a horizontal top flange, a vertical web, and another horizontal bottom flange.

I-beams

are commonly used to support heavy loads over wide spans, making them an integral part of many construction and engineering projects.

Load distribution

The primary purpose of I-beams is to distribute loads efficiently. The horizontal flanges provide resistance to bending forces, while the vertical web resists shear forces. This design allows I-beams to carry heavy loads without sagging or failing, making them ideal for supporting structures like bridges, buildings, and industrial equipment.

Versatile applications

I-beams are versatile and find applications in various industries, including construction, manufacturing, and transportation. They are used in everything from skyscrapers and warehouses to vehicle frames and shipbuilding.

I-beams

are cost-effective due to the efficiency of the manufacturing process and the material's longevity. They require less maintenance and replacement over their lifespan, reducing long-term costs.

Weldability

Hot rolled steel is highly weldable, allowing for the easy connection of I-beam sections on-site. This flexibility in joining makes it a practical choice for constructing large and complex structures.

Hot rolled steel vs. Other materials

While hot rolled steel offers significant advantages for I-beams, it's worth considering how it compares to alternative materials, such as cold-formed steel and timber.

Cold-formed steel:

Cold-formed steel I-beams are manufactured at room temperature using a process that shapes steel sheets or strips. While they have their applications, they generally offer lower ductility and resilience compared to hot rolled steel I-beams.

Timber:

Timber beams are a traditional choice for certain applications, but they lack the strength and fire resistance of hot rolled steel. Additionally, timber is susceptible to decay and insect damage, requiring more maintenance and shorter lifespans.

Conclusion

Hot rolled steel I-beams are the backbone of countless structures, providing the strength, stability, and resilience needed for diverse construction and engineering projects. Their ability to distribute heavy loads efficiently, maintain structural integrity, and resist deformation makes them indispensable in applications where durability and safety are paramount.

OzDnwhLnTBVgiXRyLSCST,What are the signs of a good quality TMT bar?,Signs of a Good Quality TMT Bar | JSW One MSME Blog,"Learn about the advantages, manufacturing process, and signs of quality in TMT bars. Click here to explore good quality TMT bars now!",Product,3 minutes,what-are-the-signs-of-a-good-quality-tmt-bar,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"TMT bars

or Thermo-Mechanically Treated bars are high-strength reinforcement bars used in construction to improve protection against natural disasters such as earthquakes and corrosion.

The manufacturing process of TMT bars involves passing hot steel through a series of rolling stands of a rolling mill, followed by passing through a quenching box where water is being sprayed on the steel bar surface at optimised pressure.

The sudden quenching and drastic change in temperature toughen the outer layer of the steel bar, making it super tough and durable while the core remains unaltered. This process of hot core heat transfer to the cold outer layer helps the outer surface to achieve better ductility without losing significant strength. The

TMT bars

are subject to atmospheric cooling to equalise the temperature difference between the soft inner core and the tough exterior. The resulting design is unique to TMT bars and gives superior ductility to the bars, making them corrosion-resistant and boosting their weldability

Some advantages of TMT bars include:

Higher tensile strength:

TMT bars have higher tensile strength and better elongation value, which means less steel is needed for the same amount of construction, making them cost-effective

Superior ductility:

TMT bars have a uniform and hardened periphery and a considerably softer core, which gives them the desired tensile strengths coupled with high elongation and ductility required in the construction of buildings located in areas with regular seismic activity

Longer life:

TMT steel

inside the concrete does not react with the moisture in the surroundings, otherwise presence of moisture may result in the formation of rust that acts like cancer and results in cracks in the concrete, weakening the structure and subsequently shortening the lifespan of the structure. TMT bars provide a longer life to the structures where they are used.

Signs of a top-quality TMT Bar

Grade certification:

The foremost sign of a high-quality TMT bar is its grade certification. Reputable manufacturers subject their bars to rigorous testing, and they proudly display the grade certifications. Look for designations like Fe415, Fe500, or

Fe550

, indicating the yield strength of the bar. Higher grades generally signify superior quality.

Uniformity in weight:

A reliable TMT bar exhibits uniform weight distribution along its length. Inconsistent weight can be a red flag, hinting at poor manufacturing processes. High-quality bars undergo precise control measures during production to ensure uniformity, contributing to the structural integrity of the construction.

Rib pattern:

The rib pattern on a TMT bar enhances its bonding with concrete. A well-designed rib pattern ensures better grip and anchorage, leading to improved load-bearing capacity. Look for bars with evenly spaced, sharp, and deep ribs, as they contribute to superior strength and stability.

Ductility:

Ductility is a crucial property in

TMT

bars, signifying their ability to deform without breaking under stress. The best bars strike a balance between strength and ductility. TMT bars with optimal ductility can absorb energy during earthquakes or other dynamic loads, enhancing the safety of the structure.

Corrosion resistance:

TMT bars are often exposed to harsh environmental conditions, making corrosion resistance a key attribute. High-quality bars come with corrosion-resistant coatings or alloys that protect them from rust and deterioration, ensuring a longer lifespan for the construction.

Weldability:

Construction often involves welding TMT bars to create a reinforced structure. A top-quality TMT bar, through precise chemistry control, exhibits excellent weldability, allowing for seamless integration without compromising its structural integrity. Inferior bars may suffer from weldability issues, leading to weak joints.

Brand reputation:

Reputation matters. Trusted and well-established manufacturers have a track record of producing high-quality TMT bars. Researching and choosing a brand with a positive reputation in the market can be a reliable indicator of the bar's quality.

Quality control measures:

Manufacturers committed to quality invest in robust quality control measures. Look for TMT bars from manufacturers who adhere to strict quality standards throughout the production process.

1VFdeQfmIIwp1CuzsplecN,Importance of rebar in concrete footings for solid foundations,Importance of TMT Rebar | JSW One MSME Blog,"Explore the vital role of tmt rebar in concrete footings, from enhancing strength and load distribution to crack control and longevity. Read our blog now!",Product,3 minutes,importance-of-rebar-in-concrete-footings-for-solid-foundations,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Rebar, short for

reinforcement bar

, is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a structural component in concrete. It is strategically placed within the concrete to provide added strength, support, and durability to the structure. Rebar comes in various grades and shapes, depending on the specific needs of the project.

The role of rebar in concrete footings

Increased strength: The tensile strength of concrete is relatively low compared to its compressive strength. By adding rebar, which has high tensile strength, it effectively compensates for this weakness. This results in a concrete footing that can better withstand the forces and loads it will experience over time. 

Reinforcements are typically positioned at the bottom of the footing's tension side, following a standard practice. In square footing, rebar is evenly distributed in both horizontal and vertical directions. In the instance of a rectangular footing, the long side features uniform

rebar

placement, but the short side differs. 

For instance, if the top bars are positioned too low or the bottom bars are raised by an extra half inch in a 6-inch-deep slab, it could potentially reduce the load-carrying capacity by 20%.

Crack control: Concrete is prone to cracking, especially under changing weather conditions and structural loads. These cracks can compromise the integrity of the footing. Rebar provides ductility in the concrete structure which limits the spread of these cracks, preventing them from becoming major issues that compromise the foundation's strength.

Load distribution: In structures that carry heavy loads, such as commercial buildings or multi-story houses, rebar ensures even load distribution. Without

rebar

, the concrete might be more susceptible to uneven settling or shifting, leading to structural instability and damage over time.

Longevity: Rebar greatly contributes to the longevity of the concrete footing. Over time, concrete can degrade due to factors like weather, moisture, and natural wear and tear. The rebar helps slow down this deterioration, maintaining the foundation's structural integrity for many years.

Resistance to environmental factors: Rebar adds a layer of protection against environmental factors like earthquakes and freeze-thaw cycles. In regions prone to seismic activity, rebar can prevent significant damage by improving the footing's ability to flex and absorb energy. In colder climates, rebar helps the concrete withstand the expansion and contraction caused by freezing and thawing, reducing the risk of cracks and damage.

Compliance with building codes: Many building codes and regulations require the use of rebar in specific types of concrete footings. Adhering to these codes is essential not only for safety but also for legal and insurance purposes. Using rebar ensures that your construction meets or exceeds these requirements.

Factors influencing rebar size

Structural load: one of the primary factors influencing rebar size is the expected structural load. Heavier loads, such as in industrial facilities or multi-story buildings, require thicker and stronger rebar to provide the necessary support. Engineering calculations are used to determine the appropriate size and quantity of rebar based on the load-bearing requirements.

Concrete strength: Stronger concrete often requires larger and more numerous rebars to effectively transfer and distribute forces. The combination of concrete strength and rebar size must be in harmony to achieve structural cohesion.

Environmental conditions: Environmental factors, including exposure to corrosion-inducing elements like saltwater, chemicals, or extreme temperatures, impact the choice of rebar size and type. In harsh environments, stainless steel or epoxy-coated rebar or specially alloyed rebar steel with improved corrosion resistance property  may be necessary to enhance durability and longevity.

Span and spacing: The distance between rebar supports, also known as ""Spacing,"" depends on the structure's dimensions and design. Adequate spacing ensures the rebar is properly distributed throughout the concrete to provide uniform support and resistance to tension.

Design considerations based on structural needs

Tension and compression: Rebar sizing is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different areas within a structure may experience varying forces, such as tension or compression. Tension zones require more substantial rebar to resist pulling forces, while compression zones may require a different configuration to support the weight effectively.

Lap length: In cases where rebar cannot be installed as a single piece, lap lengths are critical. These are the overlapping sections of rebar that maintain structural integrity. Designers must calculate the appropriate lap lengths based on structural requirements, ensuring that load transfer is seamless.

Development length: The development length is the minimum length of rebar that must be embedded within concrete to ensure a secure bond. Design considerations should account for the development length required to maintain the strength and stability of the structure.

Shape and spacing: The design should also consider the shape of the rebar, whether it's in the form of straight bars, bent shapes, or mesh. The arrangement and spacing of rebar must be carefully planned to reinforce the specific areas of a structure based on its intended use.

Conclusion

The importance of rebar in concrete footings cannot be overstated. It is the backbone of a strong, stable, and durable foundation. By reinforcing concrete with rebar, builders can create structures that are not only safe but also capable of withstanding the test of time. The use of

rebar in concrete

footings is a wise investment in the longevity and stability of any building, whether it's a home, a commercial property, or an infrastructure project. So, when it comes to constructing a solid foundation, always remember that rebar is the unsung hero that keeps your structure standing strong."

In recent years,

Thermo-Mechanically Treated (TMT) steel

has gained significant popularity in construction due to its superior strength and durability. However, welding a

TMT steel bar

comes with its set of challenges. In this blog, we will explore the intricacies of TMT steel welding, addressing common challenges and providing solutions to ensure successful welds in construction projects.

Understanding TMT

Steels for

TMT bars

are designed in such a way to provide weldability. Moreover, TMT bar undergoes a specialised manufacturing process involving controlled heating and rapid cooling to enhance its mechanical properties. This process results in a steel product with high strength, ductility, and weldability.

Properties that make TMT popular in construction

TMT's properties like high tensile strength and superior bendability make it suitable for a variety of structural applications. However, these very properties can pose challenges during the welding process.

TMT

finds applications in a range of construction projects, from high-rise buildings to bridges. Understanding its applications is crucial for welders to tailor their techniques to the specific requirements of each project.

Challenges in welding TMT bar

High carbon content and its implications

TMT's high carbon content, while contributing to its strength, poses challenges during welding. High carbon content can lead to increased hardness and promote brittleness in the Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ) and may result in issues such as cracking.

Thermal treatment effects on weldability

The thermo-mechanical treatment process alters the microstructure of TMT rebar, affecting its weldability. Welders need to be aware of these changes and adjust their techniques accordingly to prevent issues like reduced ductility.

Potential for cracking and distortion

One of the primary challenges in welding a TMT steel bar is the potential for cracking and distortion. The rapid cooling during the manufacturing process can create internal stresses that may manifest as cracks during welding.

Pre-welding preparations

Proper storage and handling of TMT steel

Before welding, proper storage and handling of a TMT steel bar are essential. Exposure to moisture and contaminants can compromise the quality of the steel and lead to welding difficulties.

Understanding TMT grades

Different grades of TMT steel have varying compositions and properties. Understanding the specific grade being used is crucial for selecting the right welding techniques and consumables. Selection of grades based on the Carbon Equivalent (CE) values is essential to ensure better weldability of the

TMT bars

.

Surface cleaning and removal of contaminants

Cleanliness is paramount in TMT welding. Proper surface cleaning and removal of contaminants, such as rust and scale, ensure a clean welding environment and prevent defects in the weld.

Welding techniques for TMT steel bar

Choosing the right welding process

Selecting the appropriate welding process is critical for TMT. Common processes include Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), and Submerged Arc Welding (SAW). Each has its advantages and challenges, and the choice depends on factors such as material thickness and project requirements.

In SMAW, an electrode with a flux coating is used. The heat generated by an electric arc between the electrode and the workpiece melts both the electrode and the workpiece, creating a weld pool. The flux coating on the electrode forms a shielding gas, protecting the weld pool from atmospheric contamination.

GMAW utilises a wire electrode that is continuously fed from a spool. The welding machine releases a shielding gas, typically a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide, to protect the weld pool from atmospheric contaminants. 

SAW is a method where the welding arc is hidden under a layer of granular flux. This layer shields the arc from air, keeping the weld clean.

Adjusting heat input and welding parameters

Controlling heat input is crucial when welding

TMT steel

. Excessive heat can lead to increased hardness and potential cracking. Welders must carefully adjust welding parameters, including voltage, current, and travel speed, to achieve optimal results.

Preheating and post-weld heat treatment considerations

Preheating the TMT before welding helps reduce the temperature differential between the weld and the surrounding material, minimising the risk of cracking. Post-weld heat treatment may also be necessary to relieve residual stresses and improve the overall weld quality.

Selecting the right consumables

Choosing appropriate welding electrodes

The selection of welding electrodes is critical in TMT welding. Electrodes with proper flux composition can help control the cooling rate, reduce the risk of cracking, and ensure a sound weld.

Importance of fluxes in TMT welding

Fluxes play a vital role in shielding the weld from atmospheric contamination. They also contribute to the overall quality of the weld by controlling the arc characteristics and providing essential elements to the molten weld pool.

In processes like GMAW, the choice of shielding gases is crucial. The right combination of gases helps achieve proper penetration and reduces the likelihood of defects in the weld.

Quality control measures

Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) for welded joints

Implementing non-destructive testing methods, such as ultrasonic testing and magnetic particle testing, is essential for verifying the integrity of welded joints. These tests can detect internal defects without compromising the structure.

Visual inspection and dimensional checks

Regular visual inspections, including checks for weld bead appearance and uniformity, are essential. Dimensional checks ensure that the weld conforms to specified tolerances, preventing potential structural issues.

Ultrasonic testing and radiography for critical welds

For critical welds, particularly in load-bearing structures, ultrasonic testing and radiography provide in-depth insights into the internal soundness of the weld. These methods are crucial for ensuring the long-term structural integrity of the welded joints.

Post-welding treatment

Stress relieving techniques for TMT

Stress-relieving post-weld heat treatments can help mitigate residual stresses in the welded joints. This is particularly important in applications where dimensional stability and long-term durability are paramount.

Machining and finishing processes

Machining and finishing processes, such as grinding and polishing, contribute to the aesthetic and functional aspects of the weld. These processes also help eliminate potential stress concentration points and improve the overall appearance of the welded structure.

Corrosion protection measures

TMT rebar

structures are often exposed to environmental elements that can lead to corrosion. Implementing effective corrosion protection measures, such as coatings or cathodic protection systems, ensures the longevity of the weld and the entire structure.

Comparison of grades

Strength differences:

When comparing different grades of OPC, one of the primary considerations is the strength variation among these grades. OPC is typically classified into Grade 33, Grade 43, and Grade 53, with each grade representing a different compressive strength. Grade 33 is characterised by a lower compressive strength compared to Grade 43 and Grade 53. The latter two exhibit higher strength properties, making them suitable for more demanding structural applications. Understanding the specific strength requirements of a construction project is crucial for choosing the appropriate OPC grade, as it directly impacts the structural integrity and durability of the final product.

Performance variations:

Beyond compressive strength, the performance of different OPC grades varies in terms of other crucial properties. This includes factors such as setting time, workability, and resistance to environmental conditions. Grade 53 OPC, for instance, not only provides high compressive strength but also tends to offer better durability and resistance to harsh weather conditions. Performance variations are essential considerations for engineers and builders to ensure that the chosen OPC grade aligns with the specific demands of the construction project, contributing to long-term stability and reliability.

The selection of an OPC grade also involves assessing the cost implications associated with each grade. Generally, higher-grade OPC, such as Grade 53, tends to be more expensive than lower-grade options like Grade 33. While higher-grade

cement

may offer superior strength and performance characteristics, it's important to strike a balance between project requirements and budget constraints. Engineers and project managers need to carefully evaluate the cost implications of different OPC grades, considering factors such as initial material costs, potential long-term savings through improved performance, and overall project budget. This informed decision-making ensures that the chosen OPC grade aligns with both the structural needs of the project and its financial constraints."

1zM94OinFvknDNI2TlOYrN,Best practices for column construction,Best Practices for Column Construction | JSW One MSME Blog,"Delve into the complexities of Reinforced Concrete Columns (RCC), and the importance of proper reinforcement detailing.",Business,3 minutes,best-practices-for-column-construction,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Steel columns

contribute significantly to the architectural and aesthetic aspects of a structure. They define spaces, support beams and slabs, and often influence the overall design. Whether in residential homes, commercial buildings, or industrial facilities, columns provide the backbone of structural integrity.

The significance of adhering to proper construction practices, particularly in the context of columns, cannot be overstated. The durability and safety of a structure hinge on the meticulous execution of construction processes. In the case of

columns

, using the right materials, employing sound design principles, and implementing precise construction techniques are imperative.

Understanding Reinforced Concrete Columns (RCC)

Concrete excels in compression, meaning it can withstand forces that compress or squeeze the material. This aligns perfectly with the primary load-bearing function of the steel column, where the weight of the structure above applies a downward force.

TMT

(Thermo Mechanically Treated) bars, on the other hand, are adept at resisting tension, or forces that attempt to pull it apart. The combination creates a structural element that can efficiently handle both compressive and tensile loads.

Types of loads columns need to resist

RCC encounters two main types of loads: Axial and lateral. 

Axial loads act along the vertical axis of the column, representing the primary compression forces due to the weight of the structure above. 

Lateral loads, however, act horizontally and may result from factors such as wind or seismic events. Steel columns must be designed to resist these lateral forces to prevent buckling or excessive deflection. 

Proper reinforcement detailing and design considerations play a vital role in ensuring that RCC can effectively resist both axial and lateral loads, maintaining structural integrity and safety.

Overview of the design process for RCC

The design process for RCC involves key steps:

Structural analysis: The first step is to conduct a structural analysis to determine the loads and forces acting on the column. This includes considering dead loads (permanent, stationary loads) and live loads (temporary or moving loads).

Material selection: Choosing appropriate materials for the column, including the type and grade of concrete and the reinforcing steel, is critical. The selection is based on factors such as the required strength, durability, and environmental conditions.

Column sizing: Sizing the column involves determining its dimensions, such as the cross-sectional area and height, to ensure it can support the applied loads while meeting architectural and space requirements.

Reinforcement design: The placement and detailing of reinforcing steel within the column are essential. This includes considerations for the spacing, diameter, and arrangement of

TMT bars

to enhance the structural performance of the column.

Detailing and construction drawings: Once the design is finalised, detailed construction drawings are created. These drawings provide instructions for the construction team regarding the placement of concrete and reinforcement, ensuring that the column is built according to the design specifications.

Factors influencing column design

Several factors influence the design of RCC:

Loads: The type and magnitude of loads, including gravity loads, lateral loads, and environmental loads, play a significant role in column design. Understanding how these loads are distributed and transmitted through the structure is crucial for sizing and reinforcing columns appropriately.

Environmental conditions: Exposure to environmental elements such as moisture, aggressive chemicals, and temperature variations can impact the durability of concrete and reinforcing steel. Design considerations must account for these conditions to ensure the longevity and performance of the columns.

Building codes and standards: Local building codes and industry standards prescribe the minimum requirements for structural design. These codes address factors such as material strength, load combinations, and safety factors, guiding engineers in designing columns that meet or exceed these requirements.

Architectural constraints: The architectural design of a structure often imposes constraints on the dimensions and aesthetics of columns. Balancing structural requirements with architectural considerations is essential for achieving a harmonious and functional design.

Construction methods: The chosen construction methods and techniques can influence column design. Factors such as formwork, concrete placement, and curing methods need to be considered to ensure the practicality and efficiency of construction.

Best practices for RCC construction

Design: The design of RCC should follow certain procedures and meet specific rules and requirements related to reinforcement ratio, size of

TMT steel

, spacing of

TMT steel bar

, size and spacing of lateral ties or spirals, thickness of concrete cover, number of the bars, and dimensions of the column. 

Formwork preparation: The formwork, which is a structure that will contain the concrete while it is poured and cured, must be built. The formwork should be strong, waterproof, and leak-proof.

Reinforcement placement: The TMT rebar must be placed inside the formwork to give the concrete greater tensile strength. The TMT steel bar should be secured with wire or reinforcement connectors to prevent them from moving during the pouring process

Concrete pouring: The concrete is poured into the formwork and compacted with a vibrator to eliminate air pockets and ensure good adhesion to the reinforcement. It is important to check the level of the mix to ensure that the column is straight and uniform

Formwork removal: After the concrete has cured, the formwork can be removed. It is important to do this carefully to avoid damaging the column

Curing: To ensure optimal strength, the column must be properly cured. This involves keeping the concrete moist for several days or even weeks, and protecting it from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures

Longitudinal bars: The size and number of longitudinal TMT rebar must be chosen to provide an area of reinforcement equal to or greater than the amount that is required, and satisfy the minimum and maximum spacing requirements.

Spirals: For cast-in-place construction, the spiral bar should not be less than No. 10 bars. The minimum clear spacing is the greatest of 25 mm."

The primary objectives of heat treatment include hardening, softening and modifying the properties of the steel to achieve desired outcomes such as improved machinability, formability, ductility, and grain size recovery.

Hardening heat treatments

Direct hardening:

This involves heating steel to the austenitising range (850 to 950 degrees celsius), followed by quenching (rapid cooling) and tempering at a desired temperature below austenitizing temperature.

Direct hardening increases strength and wear resistance but can decrease toughness meaning the steel doesn’t quite withstand impact. Tempering of directly hardened steel restore ductility and toughness while maintaining strength.

Austempering:

A specialised quenching technique where steel is quenched around 315 degrees celsius, above the Martensite Start (Ms) temperature, and held to undergo isothermal transformation to bainite, offering a balance of toughness and hardness. Ms varies according to the carbon and alloy content of the steel.

Austempered steel has high impact strength and a low wear rate meaning there is less material loss over time due to a mechanical action.

Martempering:

Similar to austempering but involves further quenching to Ms through Martensite finish (Mf) temperature, resulting in a martensitic structure. 

Due to the quenching process, martensite formation results in minimal residual stress. Hence the Martempered steel is dimensionally stable and warps less. Additionally, its parts will have lower distortion (expansion and contraction).

Case hardening:

Used for both low and medium/high carbon steels, the process creates a hard, wear-resistant surface and a tough, impact-resistant core.

Softening heat treatments

Full annealing:

Heating to the austenitising range followed by slow cooling. This process is ideal for hyper-eutectoid steels (0.8% to 2.1% carbon content) and those with coarse grains due to high-temperature hot working.

Full annealing reduces internal stresses and refines grain structure, making the material more pliable for further processing.

Normalising:

Heating above the critical temperature into the austenite range, then air cooling at room temperature. This refines the grain structure, improving mechanical properties like strength and toughness while reducing internal stresses.

Process annealing:

Used for work-hardened low-carbon steels, it involves heating near the lower critical temperature, followed by cooling. 

This reduces internal stresses and improves ductility. This creates a good piece for rolling, drawing, forging and extruding.

Spheroidisation:

Suitable for high-carbon steels, this process involves heating just below the eutectoid temperature for extended periods, leading to the formation of spherical cementite particles.

Spheroidisation improves the machinability and formability of the steel by transforming the microstructure into spheroidised carbide particles embedded in a soft ferrite matrix..

Induction and flame hardening:

Localised surface heating by oxy-acetylene or oxy-propane flame (known for their high temperatures) or induction current, followed by quenching. This is used for medium and high-carbon or alloy steels.

Induction hardening is commonly used for selective hardening of toothed surfaces, gears, shafts, and bearing races.

Flame hardening is often used for large components such as axles, crankshafts, and certain machine parts.

Heat treatment techniques for

hot rolled

and

cold rolled steels

are diverse and tailored to specific requirements. The selection of a particular method depends on the desired mechanical properties, the steel's composition, and the final application. By leveraging these techniques, one can significantly enhance the performance and longevity of steel products."

The

TMT steel

manufacturing process involves a strategic manipulation of temperature and cooling rates, resulting in the formation of two distinct layers within the bars. The outer layer, known as martensite is tough, providing the necessary strength and durability. In contrast, the inner core, composed of ferrite-pearlite, offers flexibility and bendability.

The precise control of cooling rates, rolling temperature, rolling speed and during treatment determines the hardness or softness of these layers, influencing the overall properties of the

TMT steel bar

. This metallurgical approach, driven by the interplay of iron's three allotropes - austenite, martensite, and ferrite-pearlite - yields steel rods that exhibit mechanical characteristics and corrosion resistance with weldability, making them indispensable in the construction industry.

In this blog, we discuss the process of selecting the right TMT steel bar for your project, covering key considerations, grades, standards, and more.

Project requirements assessment

1. Project type: Whether you are constructing a residential building, a commercial complex, or an industrial facility, the type of project will significantly impact your choice of TMT.

2. Location: The geographic location of your project matters. For instance, coastal areas may require higher corrosion-resistant TMT rebar due to salt exposure.

3. Load-bearing capacity: Your project's load-bearing requirements will dictate the grade and strength of TMT steel bar you need. Ensure that your chosen TMT can withstand the anticipated loads.

Key factors to consider before selecting TMT

1. Certifications and standards

Look for TMT bars that are ISO-certified and have a certification from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). These certifications ensure that the TMT bar meets the required quality and safety standards.

2vrCQGPRb7UyYkdvGh3ay3,Optimising microstructure in hot rolled steel for springs,Optimising Hot Rolled Steel Microstructure for Springs | JSW One MSME Blog,"Delve into the crucial relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties, understanding how factors like elasticity, strength, and fatigue resistance impact precision spring performance. ",Product,3 minutes,optimising-microstructure-in-hot-rolled-steel-for-springs,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Precision springs are used in various industries - from automotive and aerospace to electronics and healthcare. They are crucial in ensuring proper functionality and safety in devices as diverse as suspension systems, medical instruments, and precision machinery. 

Precision springs operate under stringent conditions, requiring specific mechanical properties to perform their intended functions effectively. Factors like tensile strength, yield strength, and fatigue resistance must be carefully controlled to ensure the spring can endure repeated compression and expansion cycles without failure. 

Microstructure optimisation is vital in precision springs when using

hot-rolled steel

. Through precise temperature and cooling control during the

hot rolling process

, manufacturers can manipulate the grain size, distribution, and orientation within the steel.

Mechanical properties relevant to precision springs

Elasticity and spring constant:

Elasticity is the ability of a material to deform reversibly under an applied load and return to its original shape when the load is removed. In precision springs, elasticity is paramount as springs must be able to repeatedly deform and then return to their initial state without permanent deformation.

The spring constant (or stiffness) measures how stiff or flexible a spring is. It determines the relationship between the force applied to the spring and the resulting displacement. High spring constants indicate stiff springs, while low values suggest flexible ones.

Strength and toughness:

Strength refers to a material's ability to withstand an applied force without failing. High strength is essential in precision springs, especially those subject to high loads to prevent permanent deformation or failure.

Toughness is the ability of a material to absorb energy and deform plastically before fracturing. Toughness is crucial for preventing brittle fracture, especially in applications with dynamic loading.

Fatigue resistance:

Fatigue resistance is a critical property for precision springs subjected to cyclic loading. Springs must resist fatigue failure, which occurs when repeated cyclic stresses lead to cracks and eventual fractures.

Fatigue resistance is assessed through fatigue testing, which involves subjecting the spring to cyclic loading until failure. Springs with high fatigue resistance have longer lifespans in service.

The relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties

Grain size:

Smaller grains tend to result in improved strength and toughness, as well as enhanced fatigue resistance.

Phase composition:

Specific phases, like martensite or austenite, can enhance strength or toughness, depending on the application.

Inclusions and defects:

Impurities, inclusions, or defects can weaken the material, reducing its mechanical properties.

Importance of precision in mechanical properties for spring applications

Consistent performance:

Springs are designed to operate within specific force-displacement ranges. Precise mechanical properties ensure consistent performance across a batch of springs.

Safety:

In applications where springs play a critical role, such as in automotive suspensions or medical devices, deviations in mechanical properties can lead to safety hazards or malfunctions.

Predictable behaviour:

Precision springs are often used in mechanisms where their behaviour must be highly predictable. Deviations in stiffness or fatigue resistance can lead to unexpected outcomes.

Longevity:

Precision springs are expected to have long lifespans. Precise control over mechanical properties can extend the service life of these components.

Factors influencing microstructure in hot-rolled steel

Temperature and cooling rate during hot rolling

Hot Rolling temperature:

The temperature at which steel is rolled significantly affects its microstructure. Higher rolling temperatures produce finer grains and a more uniform microstructure, while lower temperatures result in coarser grains. The choice of rolling temperature depends on the desired properties and end-use of the steel product.

Cooling rate:

After

hot rolling

, the cooling rate also impacts the microstructure. Faster cooling rates, achieved through water quenching, promote the formation of a fine-grained structure with improved mechanical properties, including strength and toughness. Slower cooling rates can produce coarser grains.

Alloy composition and its impact on microstructure:

Alloying elements:

The composition of steel alloys plays a significant role in determining its microstructure. Different alloying elements, such as carbon, manganese, silicon, and various trace elements, influence the formation of phases within the steel. Carbon content, for instance, affects hardness and strength, while other alloying elements can enhance corrosion resistance, ductility, and other properties.

Phase transformations:

Alloy composition affects the phase transformations that occur during cooling. For example, adding alloying elements like chromium or nickel can promote the formation of specific phases, such as martensite or austenite, which have distinct microstructures and mechanical properties.

Heat treatment methods

Annealing:

It involves

heating the steel

to a specific temperature and then slowly cooling it to achieve the desired properties. This process can refine the grain structure, relieve internal stresses, and enhance ductility.

Quenching and tempering:

Quenching (rapid cooling) and tempering (subsequent controlled heating under critical temperature) are employed to achieve specific microstructures and mechanical properties for certain applications. Quenching can result in a hardened microstructure, while

tempering

can improve toughness and reduce brittleness.

Mechanical working and deformation

Rolling process:

The amount of deformation, rolling speed, and the number of rolling passes influence grain size and shape. Proper control of these parameters is essential for achieving desired microstructures.

Forging and extrusion:

Besides

hot rolling

, other mechanical working processes like forging and extrusion can further refine the microstructure of steel. These processes involve shaping the steel under high pressure and temperature conditions, resulting in grain size and orientation changes.

Role of impurities and inclusions:

Impurities: Sulphur and phosphorus, can negatively affect steel microstructure. These impurities can lead to the formation of undesirable phases and inclusions, which can weaken the material. Strict quality control measures are necessary to minimise contaminants.

Inclusions: Inclusions are non-metallic particles or substances found in steel. Their size, shape, and distribution can influence the microstructure and mechanical properties. Inclusions can act as stress concentrators, reducing the material's strength and fatigue resistance."

mQY1wUQhNSl9JI2TgaNAH,Practical tips to optimise cash rotation for MSMEs in the steel industry,Cash Rotation for MSMEs in the Steel Industry | JSW One MSME Blog,"Learn how optimising cash rotation can boost your MSME's financial health, and help navigate the unique cash flow challenges faced by steel businesses. ",Business,3 minutes,practical-tips-to-optimise-cash-rotation-for-msmes-in-the-steel-industry,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Cash rotation is a critical aspect of financial management for

MSMEs in the steel industry

. It refers to the speed at which cash flows in and out of your business and can significantly impact your company's financial health. In this blog post, we will explore practical tips and techniques to optimise cash rotation and ensure the sustainability and growth of your steel business.

Understanding cash rotation in the steel industry

Cash rotation starts when the company buys things they need, like materials and resources. It ends when they sell the finished products and get paid in cash. The time it takes for this cycle to complete determines how much working capital the company needs. Working capital is an MSME's everyday money. It's what they use to pay for running day to day operations of the business.

If it takes a long time for money to go around the cycle, they need a lot of working capital to keep it going. But However, if it is faster, the churn of working capital is quicker. This leads to better operations

Cash rotation is a measure of how efficiently you manage your cash flow. It's different from profitability since you can have profits on paper but still need help with cash flow issues. For MSMEs in the

steel industry

, understanding this difference is crucial. Seasonality, long customer payments to suppliers and vendors, and market fluctuations can make cash rotation challenging.

The benefits of efficient cash rotation

Efficient cash rotation offers several advantages for small steel businesses. It ensures you have the liquidity to cover operational expenses, invest in growth opportunities, and weather financial storms. By managing your cash flow effectively, you can avoid costly borrowing and late payment penalties, ultimately improving your bottom line.

Common cash flow challenges in the steel industry

Small steel businesses often face specific cash flow challenges. Seasonal demand can lead to uneven cash inflows, while long customer payment terms can tie up your working capital. Additionally, the steel market's volatility can create uncertainty, making it challenging to predict cash flow accurately.

Practical tips for optimising cash rotation

Negotiating favourable payment terms with suppliers:

Work with your suppliers to negotiate better payment terms. Extending payment terms while maintaining good relationships can free up cash for other uses.

Example: Suppose you run a small

steel fabrication business

, and one of your key suppliers offers standard payment terms. This means you have 10 days to pay your supplier after receiving the materials. However, you negotiate with the supplier to extend the payment terms to net-30 days. This adjustment gives you extra time to sell the fabricated products and receive payment from your customers before settling your supplier invoice.

Efficient inventory management:

Monitor your inventory closely to avoid overstocking or understocking. Both scenarios can tie up cash unnecessarily. Utilise just-in-time inventory practices when possible.

Example: Through careful analysis of historical sales data and market trends, you identify that certain steel products have higher demand during specific seasons. You adjust your inventory levels accordingly, stocking up on those products before the peak season hits and reducing inventory during the off-season. This practice prevents excess capital from being tied up in surplus inventory, allowing you to use the cash more efficiently in other areas of your business.

Leveraging technology:

Implement technology solutions for invoicing and payment processing. Digital invoicing and online payment options can speed up cash inflow.

Example: Instead of sending paper invoices to customers and waiting for checks in the mail, you implement an online invoicing and payment system. This allows you to send invoices electronically, and customers can conveniently pay via credit card or electronic funds transfer. As a result, you receive payments faster, reducing the gap between delivering your services and receiving cash.

Diversifying revenue streams:

Explore diversification strategies within the steel industry or consider complementary business lines to create additional income sources.

Example: To diversify revenue, you can decide to offer custom steel fabrication services to meet the unique needs of various industries. By doing so, you tap into new markets and income streams.

Financial tools and resources:

Consider using financial tools to help manage your cash flow effectively. Software for cash flow forecasting, budgeting, and financial analysis can provide valuable insights into your

business's financial health

. Additionally, government programs or industry associations may offer support and resources for steel businesses.

Conclusion

Optimising cash rotation is essential for the financial health and sustainability of MSMEs in the steel industry. By understanding the challenges unique to this sector and implementing practical tips and techniques, you can ensure your

business thrives

in favourable and challenging economic environments."

Applications:

Shafts and axles: Medium carbon steel's strength and toughness make it suitable for producing shafts, axles, and crankshafts.

Rails and railway tracks are used to construct railroad tracks and other transportation infrastructure.

Springs: Medium carbon steel is often used to make springs, including coil springs and leaf springs.

High-strength fasteners: Bolts, nuts, and studs requiring greater strength and wear resistance are often made from medium carbon steel.

High carbon steel:

With carbon content exceeding 0.6%,

high carbon steel

is tough and strong. This steel finds

applications in making tools

, springs, and cutlery, where hardness and wear resistance are critical.

Applications:

Cutting tools: High carbon steel is used to manufacture chisels, knives, saw blades, and drills because of its hardness and ability to hold a sharp edge.

Springs: It's used for high-performance springs in automotive suspension systems and industrial machinery applications.

Wire and cables: High carbon steel wire is used for applications like piano wires, guitar strings, and wire ropes due to its strength and flexibility.

Blades and cutting edges: High-carbon steel produces high-quality blades, including swords, razors, and surgical instruments.

2. Ductility and toughness:

As carbon content increases, ductility tends to decrease. High carbon steel, while incredibly strong, are less ductile and can become brittle if not properly heat-treated. Alloying elements such as manganese can help balance the trade-off between strength and ductility in higher carbon steel.

3. Weldability:

Low-carbon steel is easily weldable due to its excellent ductility and low risk of cracking during welding. On the other hand, high-carbon steel requires careful preheating and post-welding heat treatment to prevent brittleness.

4. Corrosion resistance:

Carbon itself doesn't contribute to corrosion resistance, but adding elements like chromium and nickel can enhance a

steel's resistance to corrosion

.

Stainless stee

l, for instance, contains a significant amount of chromium to resist rust and staining.

5. Heat treatment:

Carbon content determines how steel responds to heat treatment processes like quenching and tempering. High carbon steel can be hardened and tempered to achieve the desired balance of hardness and toughness.

Alloy steel

Alloy steel is a highly adaptable type of steel that contains not only different levels of carbon but also other alloying elements. These elements include chromium, which strengthens and toughens the steel while also increasing its resistance to corrosion. Nickel is also added to improve resistance against corrosion and oxidation at high temperatures. Molybdenum is another element added to increase hardenability, toughness, and tensile strength. Lastly, vanadium is used to refine the grain structure of steel, which enhances its strength, toughness, and wear resistance. The carbon content in alloy steel can vary widely, depending on the desired characteristics. When you buy steel online, you see steel alloys applications in many industries, from aerospace and automotive to construction and manufacturing.

The influence of carbon on microstructure

Ferrite:

Low-carbon steel primarily consists of ferrite, a soft, ductile phase. The low carbon content allows for the formation of numerous ferrite grains, which contribute to the steel's malleability. It is highly magnetic and has high electrical resistance making it desirable for antennas and transformers.

Cementite:

High-carbon

steel

, conversely, has a microstructure rich in cementite, a hard and brittle phase. The increased carbon content forms fewer but larger cementite particles, resulting in greater hardness and reduced ductility.

Martensite:

When high-carbon steel is rapidly cooled (quenched) from a high temperature, it transforms into martensite. This phase is exceptionally hard but brittle, making it ideal for cutting tools and knife blades.

Conclusion

The effects of carbon on

steel

are nothing short of remarkable. From the malleable and ductile low-carbon steel used in everyday products to the tough and sharp high-carbon steel found in precision instruments, carbon content plays a pivotal role in determining steel's properties. Additionally, alloy steel opens up possibilities by combining carbon with other elements to create materials tailored to meet specific industrial needs. Understanding these variations in carbon content and microstructure allows us to harness the full potential of this incredible material, making it an enduring cornerstone of modern civilization."

623kg4L0nbSuI8wML37RMQ,How to cure concrete at the right temperature?,Curing Conrete at the Right Temperature | JSW One MSME Blog,"From wet curing to membrane methods and steam acceleration, uncover the techniques that yield resilient structures. ",Business,3 minutes,how-to-cure-concrete-at-the-right-temperature,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Concrete, the backbone of modern construction, is often seen as a solid, unchanging material. However, beneath its unyielding exterior lies a process known as curing, which is pivotal in determining its strength, durability, and overall quality. In this article, we'll delve into the science behind concrete curing, explore why it's crucial, demystify curing methods and provide best practices.

The process of concrete curing

Concrete is not just a mix of water,

cement

, and aggregates; it's a blend that undergoes a complex chemical reaction known as hydration. This process involves the

cement

particles reacting with water to form a crystalline structure, resulting in the hardening of the mixture. Hydration requires a continuous supply of moisture to proceed effectively.

Proper curing transforms a newly poured concrete mix into a strong and durable structure. Neglecting proper curing can lead to reduced strength, increased cracking, and diminished resistance to environmental factors.

Factors influencing the effectiveness of concrete curing

The efficacy of concrete curing is controlled by a multitude of factors that collectively determine the final quality of the cured concrete:

Ambient temperature and humidity significantly impact the hydration process, with higher temperatures accelerating reactions and lower temperatures slowing them down.

The curing duration is crucial, as premature drying can disrupt hydration. The concrete's water-cement ratio also plays a role, with higher ratios requiring longer curing to maintain proper hydration. The curing methods employed, such as wet, membrane, or curing compounds, further influence the process.

Environmental conditions like wind, sunlight, and air movement can lead to moisture loss and affect curing efficiency.

Start curing as soon as the concrete has been placed and finished to ensure proper hydration from the outset.

Maintain curing for at least seven days, as this is the critical period when concrete gains most of its strength.

Maintaining the ideal temperature during concrete curing

The ideal temperature range for curing concrete typically falls between 50 degrees fahrenheit  (10 degrees celsius) and 85 degrees fahrenheit (30 degrees celsius). This range promotes optimal hydration and ensures the concrete gains strength as intended. Extreme temperatures, whether too high or too low, can compromise the quality of the cured concrete.

Methods for temperature control

There are several methods to maintain the ideal temperature during concrete curing:
Insulation: Insulating materials like blankets or thermal covers can be placed over freshly poured concrete to retain heat and prevent temperature fluctuations.

Heating systems: In colder weather, heating systems such as radiant heaters or heated enclosures can maintain the concrete temperature within the desired range.

Cooling systems: In hot weather, misting or evaporative cooling can prevent excessive heat buildup and water evaporation.

Shade: Providing shade over the curing area can help protect the concrete from direct sunlight and high temperatures, preventing rapid drying.

Windbreaks: Wind can accelerate the evaporation of water from the surface of the concrete. Using windbreaks, such as temporary barriers, can mitigate this effect.

Concrete curing methods

Wet curing: This method keeps the concrete surface continuously moist for a specific period. Methods like ponding (involves creating shallow pools and maintaining a continuous water cover over the entire area), soaking (water is directly sprayed onto the concrete surface or applied through an irrigation system), and using wet coverings help maintain the required moisture level. Wet curing is particularly effective for preventing early moisture loss and is suitable for various projects, from sidewalks to bridge decks.

Membrane curing: Curing compounds and membrane-forming sealers (acrylic membrane sealers, chlorinated rubber sealers, wax membrane sealers) are used in this method. These compounds create a barrier on the concrete surface, preventing moisture evaporation. Membrane curing is ideal for large horizontal surfaces and can be particularly useful when water resources are limited.

Steam curing: When time is of the essence, steam curing accelerates the hydration process by raising the concrete's temperature. While this method requires specialised equipment, it can significantly reduce curing time. Careful monitoring and adherence to recommended procedures are essential to avoid cracks caused by rapid temperature changes.

Conclusion

Concrete curing is not merely an afterthought; it's a critical stage in the construction process that directly influences concrete structures' strength, durability, and overall quality. Properly maintaining the moisture level ensures that the concrete gains strength, durability, and the desired properties."
4bOFDTUb5teTOxhLrzl29Q,"Concrete spalling: Causes, effects and repair","Concrete Spalling: Causes, Effects and Repair | JSW One MSME Blog","Discover the complexities of concrete spalling – the chipping, cracking, and breaking of surfaces that can compromise structural integrity.",Business,3 minutes,concrete-spalling-causes-effects-and-repair,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"In the realm of construction, the durability and longevity of structures are paramount. However, even the most carefully designed and meticulously

constructed buildings

can fall victim to a common adversary known as concrete spalling. In this blog post, we will delve into the intricacies of concrete spalling – what it is, what causes it, and the detrimental effects it can have on the structural integrity of concrete surfaces.

What is concrete spalling?

Concrete spalling is a phenomenon that occurs when concrete surfaces start to chip, crack, and break off. It's not merely a cosmetic concern; it's a signal of underlying structural issues. Imagine a weathered sidewalk with pieces of concrete strewn about or a parking garage with chunks of concrete missing from its columns. These are textbook examples of concrete spalling, a telltale sign that something is amiss beneath the surface.

Concrete is prone to spalling when exposed to temperatures between 200 degrees Celsius and 500 degrees Celsius. Spalling can be affected by internal factors such as water-cement ratio, moisture content, aggregate types, and permeability. External factors like heating rate, fire temperature, environmental conditions (temperature and humidity), and load level can also play a role.

Causes of concrete spalling

1. Freeze-thaw cycles

One of the primary causes of concrete spalling is the relentless cycle of freeze and thaw. When water infiltrates the concrete, it occupies space within the material. During freezing, this water expands as it turns to ice, exerting pressure on the concrete. When the ice thaws, the water contracts, leaving behind voids and cracks. Over time, these cracks propagate, causing chunks of concrete to break off. Climate and geographical factors play a significant role in the severity of freeze-thaw damage.

2. Corrosion of reinforcement

Reinforcement bars play a crucial role in enhancing the structural strength of concrete. However, when moisture and oxygen reach the reinforcement, a destructive process known as corrosion begins. As the reinforcement rusts and expands, it exerts pressure on the surrounding concrete, leading to cracks and spalling. This hidden enemy can weaken structures from within, compromising their load-bearing capacity.

3. Alkali-silica reaction (ASR)

The seemingly innocuous interaction between certain aggregates and alkalis in cement can result in a destructive chemical reaction called alkali-silica reaction (ASR). This reaction produces a gel-like substance that swells upon absorbing water, causing concrete to crack and spall. Identifying ASR-induced spalling can be challenging, but it's essential for preventing further deterioration.

4. Chemical exposure

Concrete surfaces are often subjected to various chemicals, ranging from acidic solutions to sulphates. These substances can react with the concrete, weakening its structure and leading to spalling over time. This is particularly evident in industrial environments where chemical exposure is commonplace. Using chemical-resistant materials and implementing proper storage and handling practices can mitigate this cause of spalling.

Effects of concrete spalling

The consequences of concrete spalling are far-reaching and can significantly compromise the overall integrity of a structure. Firstly, the structural stability of the affected concrete is compromised, reducing its load-bearing capacity and potentially jeopardising the safety of occupants. Secondly, the aesthetic appeal of the structure takes a hit, as spalling leads to an unsightly appearance that diminishes the value of the property. Furthermore, spalled areas become more vulnerable to additional deterioration, accelerating the cycle of damage.

Prevention and remediation

1. Quality concrete mix design

The foundation of preventing concrete spalling lies in the mix design. Ensuring the proper ratio of aggregates,

cement

, water, and additives is crucial. Additionally, using appropriate aggregates and cement types for specific environments can minimise the potential for spalling.

Repair material selection:
For minor surface spalling: apply a patching compound or repair mortar designed for small repairs. These materials are typically polymer-modified and have good bonding properties.
For deeper spalling: use a repair mortar or concrete mix that matches the existing concrete in terms of strength, colour, and texture.

Mixing and application:
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for mixing the repair material. Typically, you'll need to add water and mix until you achieve a workable consistency.
Apply the repair material to the damaged area, ensuring it is compacted and properly shaped to match the surrounding surface. Use a trowel or other suitable tools for application.

Finishing:
Smooth the repaired surface to match the texture of the surrounding concrete. You can use a trowel, float, or other finishing tools to achieve the desired texture.

Curing:
Properly curing the repaired area is essential for the material to gain strength and durability. Cover the repaired section with plastic sheeting or use a curing compound to retain moisture during the initial curing period.

2. Waterproofing and sealing

Applying waterproof coatings and sealants to concrete surfaces forms a protective barrier against moisture infiltration. This is particularly important in areas prone to freeze-thaw cycles. Regular maintenance of these coatings ensures their effectiveness over time.

3. Corrosion protection

To combat reinforcement corrosion, the use of corrosion-resistant materials reinforcement is recommended. Applying protective coatings to reinforcement bars and closely monitoring signs of corrosion can extend the lifespan of concrete structures.

4. Avoiding alkali-silica reaction (ASR)

Selecting aggregates with low potential for ASR is essential. Supplementary cementitious materials like fly ash or slag can also mitigate the risk of ASR by reducing the availability of alkalis. Conducting expansion tests on potential aggregate combinations can help identify potential ASR issues early on.

5. Chemical exposure management

For environments where chemical exposure is likely, taking measures to prevent chemical ingress is vital. This includes proper storage, handling, and containment of chemicals, as well as the use of chemical-resistant barriers to protect concrete surfaces.

Repairing spalled concrete involves addressing the damaged areas and restoring them to their original condition. The specific approach for repairing spalled concrete depends on the extent of the damage and the underlying causes. Adequate curing, proper reinforcement, correct placement, and regular inspections are essential to ensure the long-term durability of concrete structures.

Consulting with a professional

engineer or concrete specialist is recommended for specific projects to determine the best approach for preventing concrete spalling."
5VMqAt6RmNmUO6Ki9LjgQ0,What is tempering of steel?,Tempering of Steel | JSW One MSME Blog,"Learn how this heat treatment process refines steel's properties, striking the perfect balance between strength and flexibility. ",Business,3 minutes,what-is-tempering-of-steel,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Tempering can be done to both hot rolled and cold rolled steel.

Hot rolled steel

is roll-pressed at very high temperatures, while

cold rolled steel

is processed at or near room temperature and then annealed or temper rolled. Tool steels are tempered at around 200-300 degrees celsius, spring steels at 300-400 degrees celsius and structural steels at 450-650 degrees celsius. In this blog, we delve into the tempering of steel, uncovering its meaning, process, and the transformative effects it has on this metal.

Understanding tempering of steel

Tempering steel is a heat treatment process that plays a crucial role in adjusting the properties of hardened steel. This process follows the initial step of hardening, during which the steel is heated to a high temperature and then rapidly cooled to achieve maximum hardness. However, steel in its fully hardened state can be brittle and prone to cracking, making it unsuitable for many applications where toughness, resilience, and flexibility are desired.

This is where tempering comes into play. Tempering involves reheating the hardened steel to a specific temperature range, typically below its critical point, and then allowing it to cool gradually.

This controlled cooling process results in a change in the steel's microstructure. The microstructure of martensite and the morphology of carbides were found to evolve over time during tempering. The type, size, and amount of carbides formed during tempering are important for the properties of the steel

The science behind tempering

The science behind tempering lies in the transformation of the steel's crystal structure. Initially, during hardening, the steel undergoes a phase transformation known as martensitic transformation, where the carbon atoms are trapped in a supersaturated solution. Martensitic transformation is a diffusionless transformation that results in a change in crystal structure from the parent austenite phase to a distorted and supersaturated martensite phase. The resulting martensite phase is known for its high strength and hardness, but also known for its brittleness.

Tempering allows some of these carbon atoms to diffuse and rearrange within the crystal lattice, reducing the internal stresses that lead to brittleness. This diffusion of carbon atoms leads to the formation of small, evenly distributed carbide particles within the steel matrix. These particles act as obstacles to the movement of dislocations, effectively strengthening the material while also increasing its toughness and resilience.

How is tempering different from annealing, hardening and quenching?

Annealing, hardening, tempering, and quenching are distinct heat treatment processes used to modify the properties of steel.

Tempering:

Tempering involves controlled heating after the steel has been quenched and hardened. The purpose of tempering is to reduce the brittleness that can occur in steel after rapid quenching. It is done at a range between 150 degrees celsius and 600 degrees celsius.

Annealing:

Annealing involves heating steel to a specific temperature and then allowing it to cool slowly in a controlled manner. This process is used to soften the metal and involves heating the steel to a temperature typically between 700 degrees celsius and 900 degrees celsius.

Hardening:

Hardening is the process of heating steel above its critical temperature (the highest temperature at which the substance can exist as a liquid) and then rapidly cooling it, usually through quenching in water, oil, or other cooling mediums. This rapid cooling locks the steel's crystal structure in a hardened state and is done  between 750 degrees celsius  to 950 degrees celsius.

Quenching:

Quenching is a process that involves rapidly cooling metal after it has been heated to a temperature greater than normal conditions. This rapid cooling changes the internal structure of the metal, leading to altered mechanical properties.

In summary, annealing softens the steel, hardening makes it harder and stronger, tempering balances hardness and toughness, and quenching adjusts the steel's mechanical properties by rapid cooling.

Effects of tempering

Increased toughness: By relieving internal stresses and promoting the formation of carbide particles, tempering enhances the steel's ability to absorb energy without fracturing. Carbides can help make the steel even stronger through a process called ""precipitation hardening”. This process happens when tiny pieces of the carbides spread out inside the steel. These little carbide pieces act like reinforcements, making the steel tougher. This makes tempered steel ideal for applications that require resistance to impact and vibrations.

Reduced brittleness: The martensite structure, which is formed during the quenching process of steel, is hard and brittle. Tempering mitigates the extreme brittleness that can result from the hardening process. This property is particularly important in applications involving sudden load changes or variable stresses.

Retention of hardness: While tempering reduces the overall hardness of the steel, it ensures a balance between hardness and toughness. The steel remains sufficiently hard for most applications while gaining improved fracture resistance.

Improved machinability: Fully hardened steel can be challenging to machine due to its extreme hardness. Tempering slightly softens the material, making it more manageable for machining processes.

Enhanced structural stability: tempered steel is less prone to warping or cracking due to temperature changes or stress, making it an ideal choice for components subjected to varying conditions.

Conclusion

By carefully controlling the heating and cooling cycles, engineers and metallurgists achieve a delicate balance between hardness, toughness, and resilience, making tempered steel an indispensable material in a wide range of applications, from construction to manufacturing and beyond. Understanding the science and significance of tempering steel provides a profound appreciation for the complex interplay between heat, microstructure, and mechanical properties that underlie the durability and versatility of this remarkable alloy."

5wRFhH1JAljuYieCoD79Ia,How to prevent construction sites from water logging?,Effective Measures to Manage Waterlogging on Construction Sites,"Learn erosion and sediment control, water management, and pre-construction techniques for safe construction.",Business,3 minutes,how-to-prevent-construction-sites-from-water-logging,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Waterlogging on construction sites can cause several problems, including slowing down construction progress, damaging building materials, and creating safety hazards for workers. When soil becomes saturated with water, it loses its strength and stability, making it difficult to support heavy loads or excavations. This can result in foundation settlements, which can compromise the structural integrity of the entire building. In addition, excess moisture can weaken concrete and masonry structures, causing cracks and spills over time.

Waterlogging can also create ideal breeding grounds for fungi and bacteria, leading to corrosion and decay of metal components and wood rot in timber structures. These microorganisms can release harmful chemicals into the environment, posing health risks to workers and residents nearby. Moreover, standing water can attract mosquitoes and other insects, increasing the risk of diseases spread by these vectors.

Causes of waterlogging

Rainfall and poor drainage: The most common cause of waterlogging is heavy rainfall, especially in regions with intense or prolonged wet seasons. If the construction site lacks adequate drainage systems or if the existing systems are poorly designed or blocked, the rainwater may accumulate on the site, saturating the soil and creating waterlogged areas.

High water table: In certain locations, the water table (the level below which the ground is saturated with water) can be naturally high. During construction, when excavations are made, the water table may rise closer to the surface, leading to waterlogging issues.

Undetected underground water sources: Sometimes, there might be hidden water sources underground, such as springs or water-bearing strata. When excavation or digging occurs, these water sources can be disturbed.

Adjacent water bodies: Construction sites situated near rivers, lakes, or ponds are susceptible to waterlogging, especially during periods of high water levels or floods. The water may seep into the construction area, causing saturation of the soil.

Compaction and impervious surfaces: During construction, heavy machinery and equipment may compact the soil, reducing its permeability. Additionally, construction activities often involve the use of impervious surfaces like concrete, which can lead to surface runoff and water accumulation in low-lying areas.

Inadequate planning and management: Sometimes, waterlogging issues can be attributed to poor planning and management of the construction site. Lack of proper grading, poorly designed drainage systems, or inadequate attention to potential waterlogging problems can exacerbate the situation.

Impact of waterlogging

Stability of structures: Waterlogged soil has reduced load-bearing capacity and stability. If the foundation of a building or any other structure is laid on waterlogged ground, it can lead to settlement, differential settlement, or even structural failure over time.

Construction progress: Waterlogging makes it challenging to carry out excavation. Delayed construction can lead to increased costs, lost revenue, and contractual issues. Excess water in the mix can weaken the concrete, leading to reduced durability and strength.

Health and safety: Standing water can create slippery surfaces, leading to an increased risk of accidents and injuries for workers. Proper water management reduces these risks, promoting a safer working environment.

Environmental impact: Excess water runoff can carry sediment, pollutants, and debris into nearby water bodies, leading to water contamination and ecosystem disruption.

Regulatory compliance: Construction projects are often subject to environmental regulations. If water logging causes issues like soil erosion or water pollution, the project might face regulatory fines, penalties, or even project shutdowns.

Erosion and sediment control measures

Diversion ditches and swales: Construct diversion ditches and swales to direct runoff away from sensitive areas and into designated sediment basins.

Silt fences and sediment barriers: Install silt fences, sediment barriers, or basins around the construction site to trap sediment and prevent it from leaving the site.

Perimeter control measures: Implement measures like gravel or rock construction entrances/exits to prevent mud and sediment from being tracked onto public roads.

Temporary mulching: Use temporary mulching and erosion control blankets on disturbed soil areas to reduce erosion and promote vegetation growth.

Vegetation management: Strategically plant vegetation to help absorb excess water and improve soil permeability. Establish vegetative buffers along watercourses and at the site's perimeter to filter and absorb runoff, reducing its velocity and trapping sediments.

Water management

Stormwater inlet protection: Install sediment filters or protect stormwater inlets with barriers to prevent sediment and debris from entering the stormwater drainage system.

Rainwater harvesting: Consider implementing rainwater harvesting systems to collect and store rainwater for on-site non-potable uses, which can reduce the volume of runoff.

Preconstruction measures

Retention ponds: Construct retention ponds or temporary storage areas to hold excess water during heavy rainfall, preventing it from accumulating on the construction site.

Waterproofing: Apply waterproofing treatments to building foundations and basements to prevent water seepage into the structure.

Grading and sloping: Properly grade the site and create gentle slopes to facilitate the natural flow of water away from critical areas.

Drainage systems: Implement effective surface drains, subsurface drains, and sump pumps to redirect water away from the construction area.

Construction waste management to prevent waterlogging

Sort waste materials at source: Separating different types of waste materials such as plastics, metals, glass, paper, and organic matter can make them easier to manage and dispose of properly.

Use designated disposal sites: Construction companies should use designated disposal sites that have proper facilities for sorting, storing, and treating waste before final disposal or recycling.

Minimise waste generation: By planning ahead and using efficient methods, construction projects can generate less waste. For example, using standardised sizes for materials can reduce leftover scraps.

Reuse and recycle: Where possible, reuse construction waste materials on site or donate them to community organisations for reusing or repurposing.

Train workers: Provide training for workers on how to handle construction waste responsibly, including proper sorting, storage, and disposal procedures.

The site management plays a crucial role in ensuring that their construction sites remain free from waterlogging by taking appropriate measures during heavy rainfall events. This includes providing temporary pumps and generators to keep up with groundwater levels and removing debris and obstructions from catch basins and culverts. The team should regularly inspect and maintain drainage channels, keeping them clear of debris to facilitate efficient water flow. Furthermore, they must communicate regularly with subcontractors and suppliers regarding the importance of keeping the jobsite clean and inspect any issues early and take corrective action promptly."

One such innovation that has revolutionised construction practices is the advent of

TMT (Thermo-Mechanically Treated) steel

. In recent times, TMT steel has gained prominence, especially during the rainy season. This blog explores why TMT is now the preferred choice for construction during the monsoon.

Understanding TMT steel

Iron ore mining:

The first step is to mine iron ore from the ground. Iron ore is a type of rock that contains iron minerals, and it's usually found in large deposits in the Earth's crust.

Iron ore processing:

The mined iron ore is then transported to a processing plant. At the plant, the iron ore is crushed into small pieces and sorted to remove impurities.

Making iron:

Next, the processed iron ore is placed in a blast furnace. The furnace is a huge structure where the iron ore is heated to very high temperatures using a combination of coke (a form of carbon) and limestone. This process removes the oxygen from the iron ore, leaving behind molten iron and slag (a mixture of impurities).

Conversion to steel:

The molten iron from the blast furnace is then sent to another furnace called a basic oxygen furnace or an electric arc furnace. In this furnace, other elements like carbon, manganese, and other alloys are added to the molten iron to create steel.

Casting:

Once the steel is ready, it is cast into large rectangular blocks called billets or blooms. These blocks are then allowed to cool and solidify.

Thermo-Mechanical Treatment (TMT):

Now comes the

Thermo-Mechanical Treatment (TMT)

process. The billets are reheated to a high temperature, making them soft and malleable.

Rolling mill:

The softened billets are then passed through a rolling mill, which is a set of rollers that shape the steel into desired shapes, like round or square bars. The rolling process also makes the steel thinner and longer.

Quenching:

After shaping, the hot steel bars are rapidly cooled by spraying water on them. This quenching process creates a strong outer layer on the steel, making it resistant to wear and tear. This is called the 'Thermex System.'

Tempering:

The quenched steel bars are reheated again, but not as hot as before, and then allowed to cool slowly. This tempering process strengthens the inner core of the steel, providing flexibility and toughness. It also creates a structure called 'Tempered Martensite,' ensuring the outer structure of the bars is tempered.

Cooling:

Finally, the bars are placed on a cooling bed for atmospheric cooling, allowing them to cool at normal atmospheric temperature. During this step, the austenitic core of the bars turns into a ferrite-pearlite structure.

Benefits of TMT steel for rainy season construction

Superior corrosion resistance:

TMT steel's unique manufacturing process forms a protective oxide layer on the surface, making it

highly resistant to corrosion

even in the presence of rainwater. This characteristic ensures the longevity and durability of the structure, even during prolonged rainy seasons.

High tensile strength:

TMT steel exhibits high tensile strength, which means it can withstand external pressures and forces. This attribute is crucial during heavy rainfall, as the structure needs to endure additional loads caused by water accumulation.

Enhanced ductility:

TMT steel's soft ferrite-pearlite core with a hard martensitic rim provides better ductility, allowing it to withstand bending and deformation without fracturing. This property is particularly advantageous during seismic events or when the structure is subjected to excessive vibrations during the rainy season.

Quick construction:

TMT steel's superior properties allow for faster construction, as it can be easily bent and shaped according to the specific needs of the project. This helps reduce construction time and minimises the risk of exposure to rain during the building process.

Cost-effective:

Though

TMT steel

has long-term benefits, including reduced maintenance and repair expenses, it makes these bars a more cost-effective option for rainy season construction.

Bonding strength:

TMT bars exhibit excellent bonding with cement, facilitated by the ribs on their surface that run along the entire length. These ribs not only offer superior bonding strength but also enhance the overall structural integrity of concrete or cement-based constructions. By combining exceptional strength and robust bonding capabilities, TMT bars contribute to the creation of durable and long-lasting structures.

Conclusion

As the rainy season presents various challenges to construction projects, it is essential to choose the right materials to ensure the safety and durability of structures. TMT steel has emerged as the preferred choice over traditional steel for rainy season construction due to its remarkable

resistance to corrosion

, high tensile strength, enhanced ductility, and overall cost-effectiveness. By investing in

TMT steel

, construction projects can be completed faster, maintain structural integrity, and stand the test of time even in adverse weather conditions. As the construction industry continues to evolve, embracing innovative materials like TMT steel will undoubtedly pave the way for safer, more sustainable, and resilient structures in the future."

From the majestic frameworks of architectural marvels that define city skylines to the intricate components that power our cutting-edge technologies, steel's significance remains undeniable.

Exploring steel colour coating

The process starts by uncoiling the coil and joining the head end of the strip to the tail end of the previous coil for continuous operation.

Pre-treatment is done to ensure a uniform and clean substrate surface, crucial for better adhesion and formability of the coated steel sheets.

Chemical pre-treatment involves strip surface washing and adding a passivation layer in four phases to improve corrosion resistance and adhesion.

A uniform primer with controlled thickness is applied on the pre-treated surface to provide flexibility and corrosion resistance.

Different types of primers are available like epoxy, polyester, polyurethane, and PVC  based on resins. Epoxy primers are preferred for roofing due to their better corrosion resistance.

The colour coating line typically has two coaters: one for the primer and another for the top coat and backing coat.

After coating, convection ovens cure the colour coatings with precise temperature controls.

Multi-layer coating can be applied for higher quality demands, with a finish coat on top of the prime coating.

The top coat contains colour pigments and additives for required colour and performance properties.

After curing, the painted strip is quenched in water, though for it to be  laminated an adhesive is applied first followed by the  laminate film being pressed onto the strip.

A protective film may also be applied to safeguard the coating during subsequent processing by the customer. Visual inspection and quality control are performed before coiling the strip.

Different types of coats used in colour coated steel

Colour-coated steel

is achieved through various coating processes, each offering a specific benefit. 

Epoxy coatings are used in colour coated steel for specific applications that require exceptional chemical resistance and adhesion. They are commonly used in industrial settings where chemical exposure is a concern.

Silicone modified polyester (SMP) coatings are blended with polyester coating to provide weather resistance and durability. 

Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coatings, known for exceptional weather resistance and colour retention, are also applied through the coil coating process using high-quality fluorocarbon and acrylic resin. SMP being a harder paint system than PVDF makes a SMP-coated material more difficult to scratch

On the other hand, plastisol coatings create a textured finish through dip-coating or rotary gravure methods. Polyurethane coatings offer flexibility and abrasion resistance through the coil-coating process.

Exploring traditional painted steel

The painting process involves applying paint to a prepared surface using a specific sequence of steps. It starts with selecting the appropriate paint resin, which determines the type of paint (e.g, acrylic, oil). Resin also helps the paint particles adhere to the surface and holds the particles together. 

Additives can be included to modify paint properties, like thickness and smoothness. Pigments are added to give the paint its desired colour. 

Solvents are used to adjust paint's consistency and drying time. Once mixed, the paint is tested before application. It can be applied with brushes, rollers, or spray equipment. After application, the paint dries, forming a solid film on the surface. Multiple coats may be required for full coverage. Proper cleanup is essential for painting tools and equipment.

Thickness comparison

Industrial painting:

Industrial painting typically involves the application of multiple layers of paint to achieve the desired thickness. The thickness may vary based on the application method, surface preparation, and the type of paint used.

Colour-coated steel:

Colour-coated steel is a pre-finished product

where a specific colour-coating is applied to the steel substrate during the manufacturing process. The colour-coating is typically applied in a controlled and automated process, ensuring uniform thickness and coverage.

Performance comparison

Durability:

Both industrial painting and colour coated steel are designed to provide durability and protection against environmental factors. However, colour-coated steel often benefits from controlled application processes, leading to better adhesion and uniformity, which can contribute to enhanced durability.

Colour retention:

Colour-coated steel tends to have better colour retention over time compared to industrial painting. The colour coating is factory-applied and specially formulated to resist fading, chipping, and uv degradation.

Corrosion resistance:

Colour-coated steel is engineered

to provide excellent corrosion resistance due to the combination of the steel substrate and the protective colour coating. Industrial painting can also offer corrosion protection but may require additional layers or specialised coatings for optimal performance.

Maintenance:

Colour-coated steel generally requires less maintenance over its lifespan compared to industrial painting. The pre-finished surface helps reduce the need for periodic repainting, saving time and costs.

Application speed:

Colour-coated steel offers faster installation times since the coating is applied during manufacturing, eliminating the need for on-site painting.

Why should you opt for colour coated steel?

Colour-coated steel offers a multitude of advantages that address the challenges posed by corrosion in various applications. The material's ability to withstand intense forming operations even in low temperatures makes it ideal for industrial use and renovation purposes alike.

Beyond its practical benefits, colour-coated steel offers aesthetic enhancement, providing architects and designers with a vast array of colour, shapes, and textures to choose from. Whether for urban buildings or traditional projects, the versatility of finishes, ranging from gloss to matt and smooth to rough, allows for creative expression in architectural design.

Additionally, the environmentally conscious aspect of

play a crucial role in numerous industries like automotive, construction, general engineering, fabrication, agriculture, and more. Despite their widespread applications, hot-rolled sheets are susceptible to rust when exposed to rising humidity levels during the monsoon season. If left untreated beyond visual detection, rust can permeate deep into the base metallic layers.

Rust, scientifically known as iron (II, III) oxides, occurs due to oxidation, reactions resulting from exposure to atmospheric variables. The presence of oxygen in the environment leads to the transfer of electrons from the metal, creating an electron deficiency, and ultimately causing the metal to degrade into a more stable oxide.

The consequences of rust on

hot-rolled steel

are significant, as it can compromise the structural integrity of the material and significantly reduce its overall lifespan. In this article, we explore effective preventative measures to combat rust formation on hot-rolled sheets.

Precautions to keep hot-rolled sheets rust-free during monsoons

Storage environment:

Avoid storing sheets in areas prone to water leaks or excessive humidity. Proper storage conditions are crucial to minimise the risk of moisture accumulation and subsequent rust formation. Use moisture-absorbing materials such as desiccants (like activated charcoal, bentonite clay, or calcium chloride etc.) or silica gel packs.

Handling:

Proper handling techniques are essential to prevent surface damage that can lead to rusting. Avoid dragging or sliding the sheets. Use appropriate lifting equipment to minimise the risk of surface defects.

Stack height and weight distribution:

Maintain an optimal stack height and ensure even weight distribution when storing

hot-rolled sheets

. Excessive weight or pressure on the lower layers can lead to deformation and increased vulnerability to rust. Store sheets  in an upright position to minimise the risk of deformation or bending.

Separation and air circulation:

Use wooden blocks or pallets to create a platform for storage, ensuring proper ventilation underneath. This helps prevent the buildup of moisture and allows any condensation to dry out, reducing the risk of rust formation. Use appropriate separators or dunnage materials between the layers to prevent direct contact and allow air circulation. Place heavier sheets or sheets at the bottom of the stack to avoid excessive pressure on the lower layers.

Transportation precautions:

During transportation, ensure that the sheets  are adequately covered and secured. Protect them from exposure to moisture, rain, or other environmental factors that can accelerate rust formation.Use plastic or metal strapping to secure the bundles during transit to maintain their rust-free condition.

Controlled environment storage:

Consider storing hot-rolled sheets in a controlled environment with regulated temperature and humidity levels. This significantly reduces the risk of rust formation and extends the lifespan of the materials.

Inventory management:

Implement a first-in, first-out (FIFO) system for inventory management. By using older sheets  before newer ones, you can avoid prolonged storage and reduce the chances of rusting.

Training and awareness:

Educate personnel involved in handling and storage about the importance of rust prevention and the specific precautions to be taken. Promote a culture of vigilance and adherence to best practices for rust-free storage. Regular visual inspections are crucial for detecting early signs of rust. Inspect the surfaces of the sheets  for any discoloration, spots, or corrosion. Promptly address any issues found, implementing appropriate measures to prevent further rusting.

Prevention is key when it comes to rust during monsoon. By proactively implementing these precautions, you can safeguard your investment, maintain the quality of hot rolled sheets, and ensure their optimal performance for years. Embrace these precautions and tackle the challenges of the monsoon season to protect your valuable assets."

Safeguard your cement bags from moisture and ensure their quality and durability with expert advice.",Product,3 minutes,essential-precautions-for-storing-cement-during-monsoon-season,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Proper cement storage during the monsoon season is critical to ensure the quality, performance, and durability of this essential construction material. Due to heavy rainfall and increased humidity, rains pose significant challenges to cement storage and preservation. If not stored properly, it can lead to lump formation, reduced strength, and even complete cement deterioration. This results in financial losses and delays in construction projects. Therefore, understanding the importance of proper cement storage during the monsoon becomes crucial for contractors, builders, and anyone involved in the construction industry. This article explores why proper cement storage during the monsoon is vital and discusses essential precautions to protect this valuable construction material from moisture-related damage.

Choosing the right storage area

The selection of a storage location depends on various factors, but here are two choices that offer optimal cement safeguarding during the monsoon season:

Sheltered storage area: Opting for a covered space provides protection from external elements, keeping the cement dry and shielded from rainwater, sunlight, extreme temperatures, dust, and pests.

Raised platforms: Elevated storage platforms create a gap between the cement stockpile and standing water, allowing for swift evaporation and natural airflow to dissipate excess moisture within the cement packaging. It is essential to ensure that the platform's base is robust enough to support the weight of the entire stockpile without any deformations or risk of collapse. Additionally, compliance with local regulations, permits, and zoning restrictions regarding height limitations and foundation stability criteria must be ensured.

Protecting cement from moisture

Tarpaulin/polyethylene sheet usage: Tightly wrap the bags with thick plastic sheets or tarpaulins before placing the cement on pallets. Ensure proper overlapping of the sheets to minimise leaks. Regularly check the covers to ensure they remain intact, replacing any torn or worn ones as soon as possible.

Selection of a dry Location: When utilising open storage areas, choose ground that slopes slightly away from the stockpiles. Look for locations that receive less precipitation due to the surrounding topography, foliage, or terrain features.

Monitor humidity levels: Use humidity sensors or hygrometers to monitor relative humidity within the storage area. If the humidity consistently exceeds the recommended levels, consider using desiccant packs or dehumidifiers to absorb excess moisture. You can use silica gel packs that can be placed near the cement bags to absorb moisture and maintain a dry environment.

Floor covering: Place wooden boards or hardboard panels directly on the soil surface underneath the storage area as they can absorb moisture from the ground and dissipate it more effectively than bare earth or gravel. Regularly inspect the floorboards for splits, signs of rot, or termite damage.

Proper Stacking: Arrange the rows or piles to encourage efficient circulation of dry air around each bag, reducing the chances of long-term absorption onto porous surfaces. Stack the bags loosely to promote intermixing and prevent excessive clumping.

Managing temperature fluctuations

Utilise insulation materials: Employ insulating blankets, such as foam or fibreglass, to create a barrier that protects stored cement from extreme temperature changes. For example, draping these blankets along walls exposed to strong winds can help maintain a stable environment. Additionally, consider using thermally resistant curtains or partitioning systems to isolate the cement storage area from the rest of the facility.

Control temperature inside storage areas: Install industrial fans to circulate air and maintain a consistent temperature throughout the storage space. During hot weather, fans can help dissipate heat and prevent cement overheating.

Stockpile management strategies: Implement a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach to cement stockpiles. This means using the oldest batches first and rotating new deliveries to the back of the stockpile. For instance, if a new batch of cement arrives, it should be placed behind the existing stockpile to ensure proper utilisation.

Handling and transportation tips

To avoid water contact during transport: Cover pallets containing cement bags with heavy-duty plastic sheets to protect them from rain. Use open top containers instead of closed ones if possible. If not, make sure the container has adequate drainage.

For proper loading and unloading procedures: Lift cement bags gently using forklifts or cranes to avoid damaging the bags. Unload pallets carefully onto wooden skids to distribute weight evenly and support stacks.

To prevent bag damage and leakage: Ensure packaging meets industry standards for handling and transportation. Place two vertical and three horizontal reinforced belts around each pallet's perimeter as extra security to absorb jarring impacts experienced in transit. Make sure tie straps pass directly beneath the lower sack lifting slots. Wrap them snugly without creating undue tension that might eventually cause tears or ripping damage.

In addition to the tips listed above, it is important to communicate schedule changes caused by bad weather to subcontractors and vendors. Regularly inspect weatherproof coatings and membranes for potential reapplication, as they may experience wear and tear from repeated heating and cooling cycles."

",Product,3 minutes,tmt-steel-manufacturing-process-a-comprehensive-guide,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"TMT (Thermo-Mechanically Treated) steel

has gained immense popularity in the construction industry due to its exceptional strength, durability, and resistance to corrosion. The

high-quality TMT steel

is divided into primary and secondary types and is produced through a precise and complex manufacturing process that involves several stages. Primary TMT bars typically have a relatively lower tensile strength and yield strength compared to secondary TMT bars. In this comprehensive guide, we delve into each step of this process of both TMT steel:

Primary Steel

The primary steelmaking process involves the following steps:

1. Pretreatment of raw materials. The mined iron ore undergoes processing to remove impurities and improve quality. This may include crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, and/or flotation to obtain a concentrate. This is followed by sintering which means heating it to high temperatures in the presence of coke and limestone. This process produces clinker that is rich in iron. 

2. Blast furnace smelting: Sintered iron ore, coke, and limestone are charged into a blast furnace. The blast furnace is a tall, cylindrical furnace that is heated by hot air blown into the bottom of the furnace. The coke burns in the blast furnace and produces carbon monoxide, which reduces iron ore to molten iron. Limestone reacts with the impurities in iron ore to form slag. This is a molten waste product removed from the top of the blast furnace.

3. Basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS): The molten iron from the blast furnace is transferred to a BOS furnace. In the BOS furnace, oxygen is blown through the molten iron, which oxidises the carbon and other impurities in the iron. This process lowers the iron carbon content and produces molten steel.

4. Alloy addition: The molten steel from the BOS furnace may be alloyed with other elements, such as manganese, chromium, and nickel. These alloying elements are added to the molten steel to give it the desired properties.

5. Casting: Molten steel is then cast into moulds to produce ingots or slabs. The ingots or slabs are then further processed to produce the desired finished steel products.

Secondary Steel

The secondary steelmaking process is the second step in steel production. It adjusts the chemical composition of the steel to the desired specifications. The secondary steelmaking process typically involves the following steps:

1. Ladle furnace refining: This includes reusing scrap metal generated during production and recycling cooling water. In the ladle furnace, the steel is heated and stirred. This process helps to remove impurities from the steel and to distribute the alloying elements evenly throughout the steel.

2. Melting: The prepared scrap steel is then melted in an electric arc furnace or a basic oxygen furnace. The intense heat melts the steel, resulting in molten metal.

3. Desulphurisation: The steel sulphur content is adjusted by adding lime to the molten steel. The lime reacts with the sulphur to form slag, which is a molten waste product that is removed from the top of the ladle furnace.

4. Continuous casting. Molten steel is then cast into molds to produce ingots or slabs. The ingots or slabs are then further processed to produce the desired finished steel products.

5. Hot Rolling: The solidified billet, bloom, or slab is then reheated in a furnace to a temperature suitable for hot rolling. Hot rolling involves passing heated steel through a series of rolling mills that reduce its thickness and shape it into the desired form.

6. Cold rolling: In some cases,

hot-rolled steel

may undergo additional cold rolling processes to achieve dimensional tolerances, surface finishes, or mechanical properties.

Cold rolling

involves passing hot-rolled steel through a series of rollers at room temperature, which further reduces its thickness and improves its surface finish.

7. Quenching: Following the hot rolling stage, the TMT bars undergo a quenching procedure whereby they are passed through a series of water jets or cooling pipes. This rapid cooling causes the outer surface to cool quickly while the core remains hot. Consequently, the surface layer hardens and forms a martensitic structure, while the core retains its relative softness and ductility.

8. Self-tempering: After the quenching process, the TMT bars are left to cool naturally in the ambient air. During this period, the heat from the hot core of the bar transfers to the hardened surface, resulting in a self-tempering effect. This self-tempering process gives rise to a tough and ductile ferrite-pearlite microstructure in the TMT bars, enhancing their strength and flexibility.

9. Atmospheric cooling: Once the self-tempering phase is complete, the TMT bars are allowed to cool down to room temperature in the open air. This atmospheric cooling step further stabilises the microstructure and helps alleviate any remaining residual stresses.

To build climate-conscious constructions, everyone must collaborate, including engineers, architects, and contractors. It is also essential to use alternative materials that are more environmentally friendly than traditional ones. 

Unfortunately, the construction industry is responsible for approximately 25 percent of Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) as stated by the McKinsey report. Concrete, made from cement, is the largest contributor. It accounts for 4.5 percent of global GHG emissions and 7.0 percent of CO2 emissions in 2019. To effectively address the climate challenge, it is crucial to decarbonise the cement and concrete sector. However, existing technologies can only achieve a 30 percent reduction in carbon emissions. This falls short of the global target of limiting temperature increases to 1.5 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and implement innovative technologies such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation, And Storage (CCUS).

Objectives which green cements serves

Green cement

is an alternative to traditional cement that aims to reduce environmental impact. It addresses concerns related to carbon emissions, energy consumption, and resource depletion.

Traditional cement production contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to clinker production. Clinker is produced by heating limestone and other raw materials at high temperatures, resulting in carbon dioxide (CO2) release. Additionally, the extraction of raw materials, such as limestone and clay, and the energy-intensive process of grinding and blending them further contribute to the environmental footprint of cement production.

Strategic advantages of green cement to mitigate environmental issues:

Substitute materials: Green

cement

incorporates alternative materials, such as industrial byproducts and waste materials. For example, fly ash, a byproduct of coal-fired power plants, and slag can be used to replace clinker. These materials possess cement-like properties and reduce the need for extracting virgin raw materials, reducing carbon emissions and waste.

Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU): Some green cement technologies utilise carbon capture and utilisation techniques to capture CO2 emissions from cement plants and other industrial sources. This captured CO2 can be used in producing aggregates, as a raw material for the synthesis of alternative cementitious materials, or for enhanced oil recovery.

Carbonation: Carbonation is a process where CO2 is absorbed by cementitious materials, resulting in their transformation into a more stable and durable form. This process can be accelerated during the curing or manufacturing stages, effectively sequestering CO2 and reducing the carbon footprint of cement.

High energy efficiency: Green cement production employs advanced kiln technologies, using alternative fuels, and optimising production processes. These measures help reduce the energy consumption associated with cement manufacturing.

Recycling and reuse: Green cement uses recycled materials like concrete rubble or demolished concrete, as aggregates in new cement production. By diverting waste from landfills and reusing materials, it reduces the demand for virgin resources and minimises the environmental impact of cement production.

It's imperative to note that while green cement offers environmental benefits, its adoption and market penetration are still growing. Challenges remain in terms of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and compatibility with existing construction practices. However, ongoing research and development efforts continuously improve green cement technologies, making them more viable and accessible for the construction industry.

Green Construction Materials

Green construction materials are crucial components of sustainable building practices. They are selected based on their environmental impact, resource efficiency, durability, and recyclability. Here are some notable green construction materials:

Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS): GGBS is a supplementary cementitious product used as a partial replacement for

Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)

. It is produced by quenching molten iron slag from blast furnaces and grinding it into a fine powder. GGBS has a low global warming potential and helps reduce carbon emissions in concrete production. It enhances concrete's durability and strength, making it suitable for sustainable construction projects.

Portland Slag Cement (PSC): PSC is a blended cement that combines high-quality clinker with superior-quality granulated blast furnace slag.

This cement

offers several advantages, including high resistance to sulphate and chloride attacks, lower hydration heat, and reduced water demand. PSC promotes sustainable construction practices by utilising a byproduct of the steel industry and enhancing the overall performance and durability of concrete structures.

Concreel HD:

Concreel HD

is a high-performance cement specifically designed for demanding applications that require high-strength concrete. It is commonly used in projects such as bridges, dams, nuclear power plants, precast, and prestressed concrete structures. By providing exceptional strength and durability, Concreel HD contributes to long-lasting and sustainable infrastructure.

Composite Cement: Composite cement is a versatile option suitable for both general-purpose applications and special projects. It combines the benefits of different cementitious materials to achieve high workability, durability, and strength development.

Composite cement

is an efficient solution which also maintains sustainability principles.

Green buildings aim to minimise negative human impacts on the environment while maximising positive outcomes for society. By focusing on sustainable design principles like energy efficiency, recycled content, and renewable resources, buildings reduce resource consumption and waste production. In turn, these measures contribute to broader goals of conservation, preservation, and restoration of ecological systems around us."

Grain boundaries, which are the interfaces between adjacent grains, play an important role in determining these properties. We examine how grain boundaries influence

the mechanical properties of cold-rolled steel

, shedding light on their role in controlling strength and durability.

Grain boundaries can be defined as the interfaces between adjacent crystallites or grains in a polycrystalline material. They are generally classified into two main categories, high-angle and low-angle grain boundaries, based on their respective misorientation angles.

Influence of grain boundaries on mechanical properties of cold-rolled steel

Grain boundaries in

cold-rolled steel

are formed during the manufacturing process and play a significant role in the material's mechanical properties in the following ways:

Strength enhancement: The material of grain boundaries can be strengthened by reducing dislocation motion. Linear defects called dislocations in crystals cause plastic deformation. Dislocation movement is restricted by grain boundaries, which also increases the material's strength.

Grain size refinement: Steel grain size decreases during

cold rolling

. Greater density of grain boundaries is caused by smaller grain sizes. Greater strength and hardness are obtained as a result of the increased barriers to dislocation motion that larger grain boundaries give.

Ductility and toughness: The way grains are arranged in cold-rolled steel affects its ability to stretch and its toughness. When grains slide past each other along the boundaries, it allows the steel to bend without breaking, making it more flexible. However, some grain boundaries can actually cause cracks to start and spread, making the steel less tough. How the grain boundaries behave determines the balance between the steel's ability to stretch and its toughness.

Grain boundary corrosion: When steel is cold rolled, the size of its grains becomes smaller. This means that there are more boundaries between the grains. These boundaries make the steel stronger and harder because they create obstacles that prevent the movement of defects within the steel.

How can MSMEs leverage grain boundary engineering to enhance their products' performance?

Improved mechanical properties: By optimising the grain boundaries, they can enhance mechanical properties such as strength, ductility, toughness, and hardness. This enables MSMEs to offer high-quality, reliable products that meet or exceed customer expectations.

Enhanced corrosion resistance: Grain boundary engineering (a technique that involves controlling the structure and properties of grain boundaries) can also improve the corrosion resistance of cold rolled steel. This can be particularly advantageous in industries where corrosion resistance is crucial, such as construction, automotive, or marine sectors.

Tailored material properties: By controlling grain boundary characteristics, such as size, orientation, and density, they can develop customised materials that offer superior performance for specific industry requirements. This allows MSMEs to target niche markets or offer specialised solutions, giving them a competitive edge.

in various industries, including automotive and construction. Further studies can focus on investigating the effects of additional factors on grain boundaries, such as temperature and strain rates.

Computational methods, such as molecular dynamics simulations and finite element analysis, can be employed to study grain boundaries in cold rolled steel. These simulations provide insights into grain boundary behaviour, deformation mechanisms, and the effects of various parameters on mechanical properties.

In conclusion, grain boundaries play a crucial role in the mechanical properties of cold-rolled steel. Understanding their formation, behaviour, and impact is important in the optimization of cold-rolled steel for a variety of applications. By studying grain boundaries, material engineers and researchers can further advance the field of materials science and improve the mechanical properties of cold-rolled steel."
7uIDU24kEKS2kjnBy8Sa4q,Annealing in steel and its benefits in the Pre-engineered steel buildings ,Understanding annealing in steel and its benefits in the Pre-engineered steel buildings ,Discover the concept of annealing in steel and how it brings valuable advantages to the Pre-Engineered Building (PEB) industry in this blog,Business,3 Mins,what-is-annealing-in-steel-and-what-are-its-benefits-in-the-peb-industry,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Annealing is a heat treatment process that alters the physical and sometimes chemical properties of a material, specifically steel, to increase its flexibility and reduce its hardness, making it easier to work with.

During annealing, the steel is heated above its recrystallisation temperature for a specific period of time and then slowly cooled. The cooling rate varies depending on the type of metal being annealed. For instance, steel is typically allowed to cool naturally in still air, while metals like copper, silver, and brass can either be cooled slowly in the air or rapidly quenched in water.

The heating process causes the atoms within the steel's crystal lattice to rearrange and reduces the number of imperfections, known as dislocations, resulting in changes in flexibility and hardness. As the material cools, it undergoes recrystallisation, forming new crystal grains. The size of these grains and the composition of the phases within the steel are determined by the heating and cooling rates, ultimately influencing the material's properties.

How does annealing furnace work?

The annealing process consists of three stages: recovery, recrystallisation, and grain growth. Here's how each stage works:

1. Recovery Stage:

During this stage, the furnace or heating device raises the material's temperature to a point where internal stresses are relieved.

2. Recrystallisation Stage:

By heating the steel above its recrystallisation temperature (but below its melting point), new grains form without any residual stresses.

3. Grain Growth Stage:

Gradual cooling of the material at a specific rate leads to the development of new grains, making the steel more workable.

Following annealing, subsequent operations can be carried out to modify the mechanical properties as needed. Overall, annealing plays a crucial role in relieving internal stresses, enhancing the workability of the steel, and allowing for further operations to alter its mechanical properties.

Advantages and disadvantages of annealing

Advantages

Annealing offers several advantages by enhancing the workability of a material, improving its toughness, reducing hardness, and increasing its ductility and machinability. Additionally, the heating and cooling process reduces brittleness in metals and enhances their magnetic properties and electrical conductivity.

Disadvantages

One of the primary limitations of annealing is that it can be a time-consuming process, particularly for materials with high temperature requirements. Cooling such materials to the desired level can take a significant amount of time, especially if they are allowed to naturally cool inside an annealing furnace.

Benefits of annealing in the Pre-engineered steel buildings (PEBs)

1.

Improved Ductility:

Annealing involves heating the steel components of PEBs to a specific temperature and then cooling them slowly. This process enhances the ductility of the metal, making it more flexible and less prone to cracking or breaking under stress. Improved ductility ensures that PEBs can withstand dynamic loads, seismic forces, and extreme weather conditions, making them highly reliable and durable structures.

2.

Reduced Hardness:

During the annealing process, the hardness of the steel is significantly reduced. This makes the material more workable and easier to shape or manipulate. Pre engineered steel building contractors can benefit from this property by efficiently fabricating the steel components, such as beams, columns, and trusses, according to specific design requirements. The reduced hardness also contributes to easier onsite assembly, saving time and labor costs.

3.

Enhanced Structural Stability:

Annealing helps eliminate residual stresses in the steel, which may have been introduced during manufacturing or fabrication processes. By relieving these stresses, the structural stability of Pre engineered buildings is improved. This ensures that the building maintains its integrity over time, even in challenging conditions or under heavy loads.

4.

Prevention of Brittle Failure:

By carefully controlling the cooling rate during annealing, the formation of brittle phases in the steel can be minimised. Brittle failure can be a significant concern in structural applications, as it can lead to sudden and catastrophic structural collapses. Annealing reduces the risk of brittle failure, making pre-engineered buildings safer and more reliable structures.

5.

Tailored Properties:

Annealing can be customised to achieve specific properties based on the desired application. Through precise control of the heating and cooling process, manufacturers can fine-tune the mechanical properties of the steel, such as hardness, strength, and toughness. This flexibility allows PEBs to be optimised for various structural requirements, ensuring optimal performance in specific environments.

6.

Cost-Effective Solution:

The benefits of annealing in the Pre-engineered steel buildings translate into cost savings. The improved workability and reduced risk of failure lead to efficient fabrication, easier installation, and long-term durability. These factors contribute to lower maintenance costs, extended lifespan of the structure, and reduced risks of unexpected repairs or replacements.

Annealing holds a crucial role as a heat treatment process in the production of intricate components and those that undergo multiple operations to achieve their final shape. However, annealing necessitates meticulous planning and precise implementation. By understanding the appropriate material composition, annealing can effectively enhance the malleability of various metals. While it is commonly employed for carbon steel and cast iron, it also offers significant advantages when applied to other materials like copper, aluminum, and brass."
6EiWEhWvmGS4jLfLq7eB5c,Your ultimate guide to maintaining concrete structures  ,Essential Guide to Maintaining Concrete Structures: Tips and Best Practices,"Learn essential tips and best practices for maintaining concrete structures. Enhance durability, prevent damage, and extend lifespan with proven maintenance strategies.",Product,3 Mins,your-ultimate-guide-to-maintaining-concrete-structures,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Cracks or ruptures in concrete are uncommon unless subjected to significant force. However, concrete surfaces exposed to the elements, such as building exteriors, patios, driveways, and other structures, can deteriorate over time. Similarly, interior concrete floors in warehouses and factories are prone to scratches and dents due to grease, oil, and equipment contact. Not only are these flaws unappealing, but they can also compromise the safety and integrity of the structures.

Fortunately, complete replacement is rarely necessary, but the knowledge and skills required for repairs often deter individuals. It becomes crucial to understand how to maintain concrete properly. That's why JSW One MSME has compiled a few helpful tips to assist you in this regard.

Concrete Mix Design:

Proper concrete mix design is fundamental to ensure the durability and longevity of a structure. Factors to consider include:

Aggregate Selection: Choose aggregates that are clean, durable, and free from deleterious substances. Optimal grading and particle size distribution enhance the concrete's strength and resistance to cracking.

Cementitious Materials: Select cementitious materials with the appropriate composition and properties for the intended application. Supplementary cementitious materials like fly ash or slag can enhance concrete performance.

Water-Cement Ratio: Maintain a suitable water-cement ratio to achieve the desired strength and durability. A lower water-cement ratio minimises porosity and improves resistance to chemical attacks and freeze-thaw cycles.

2. Protective Measures:

To safeguard concrete structures from damage, various protective measures should be employed.

Concrete Coatings and Sealants: Apply protective coatings and sealants to concrete surfaces to minimise moisture intrusion, chemical exposure, and carbonation. Choose coatings based on the specific requirements of the structure and environmental conditions.

Waterproofing Systems: Implement waterproofing systems, such as membranes or cementitious coatings, to prevent water penetration. Proper surface preparation and application techniques are crucial for the effectiveness of these systems.

Corrosion Protection: Reinforced concrete structures should have appropriate corrosion protection measures in place. This can include the use of corrosion inhibitors, cathodic protection systems, or protective coatings for reinforcement.

3. Inspection and Monitoring:

Regular inspections and monitoring play a vital role in maintaining concrete structures. Key considerations include:

Visual Inspections: Conduct thorough visual inspections to identify surface cracks, spalling, efflorescence, or signs of distress. Document and monitor any changes in the structure over time.

Non-Destructive Testing (NDT): Utilise NDT techniques like ultrasonic testing, radar imaging, or rebound hammer tests to assess the internal condition of the concrete and identify potential defects or delamination.

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM): Implement SHM systems to monitor the performance and integrity of the structure continuously. This may involve sensors, strain gauges, or displacement monitoring to detect deformation, settlement, or excessive loads.

4.

Repair and Rehabilitation:

Timely repair and rehabilitation are crucial for addressing concrete damage and preventing further deterioration.

Crack Repair: Employ suitable crack repair techniques based on the crack width, depth, and location. Options include epoxy injection, polyurethane grouting, or routing and sealing with appropriate sealants.

Spalling and Delamination Repair: Repair localised spalling or delamination using methods like patching, shotcrete, or repair mortars. Ensure proper surface preparation and bonding to achieve effective repairs.

Structural Strengthening: Implement strengthening measures when required, such as carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) wraps, external post-tensioning, or additional reinforcement, to enhance the load-carrying capacity of the structure.

5. Concrete Durability Enhancements:

To improve the durability of concrete structures and mitigate potential damage, consider the following measures:-

Air Entrainment: Incorporate air-entraining admixtures during concrete mixing to create small, evenly distributed air bubbles. This helps reduce damage caused by freeze-thaw cycles and enhances resistance to de-icing salts.

Pozzolanic Materials: Utilize pozzolanic materials, such as silica fume or metakaolin, as partial replacements for cement. These materials enhance the concrete's resistance to chemical attacks, improve impermeability, and increase overall durability.

High-Performance Concrete (HPC): Consider using high-performance concrete, which typically has lower water-cement ratios, increased cementitious content, and improved aggregate quality. HPC provides enhanced strength, durability, and resistance to cracking.

Maintaining concrete structures requires a technical approach that encompasses proper mix design, protective measures, regular inspections, and effective repair strategies. By following these recommendations, you can effectively maintain and repair your concrete structures, ensuring their longevity. Always adhere to the manufacturer's guidelines and choose appropriate products from reputable construction companies suitable for your specific type of concrete."
sYhagT3srG5b67IFz0GmG,Why choosing quality over price matters when it comes to steel,Importance of Choosing Quality Over Price When it Comes to Steel,"Understand the long-term benefits, durability, and reliability of choosing high-quality steel for your projects in this blog.",Business,3 Mins,why-choosing-quality-over-price-matters-when-it-comes-to-steel,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"In today's cost-conscious world, it's no surprise that people are often drawn to the lowest priced options available. Whether it's groceries, clothing, or household items, finding a bargain can bring a sense of satisfaction.

However, when it comes to purchasing steel, the lowest price tag should not be the sole determining factor. Steel is a fundamental material used in countless industries, including construction, manufacturing, and infrastructure development. Its strength, durability, and versatility make it an indispensable resource.

Unfortunately, the allure of a low price can sometimes blind us to the potential drawbacks and risks associated with opting for the lowest priced steel. While it may seem like an attractive proposition to save money upfront, the reality is that not all steel is created equal. The lowest priced steel often comes with compromises in quality, which can have significant consequences for your projects and investments.

In this blog post, we will delve deeper into the reasons why the lowest priced steel isn't always the better choice.

1.  Low quality raw material -

Purchasing low cost steel presents a clear and significant issue: the possibility of receiving inferior-quality metal. This can lead to a multitude of problems, both in the short and long term, such as premature failures, difficulties in forming the metal, lack of warranties, and more. These issues not only impact your customers directly but also reflect poorly on your business. Using cheap, low-quality materials can result in negative reviews, financial losses, wasted time on repairs, and potentially even more severe consequences.

2.  Lower quality paint/coat

- Lower quality paint on low-priced steel compromises performance. It lacks protective properties, leading to accelerated corrosion and reduced lifespan. The paint fades, chips, and peels over time, resulting in maintenance and repainting costs. High-quality paint, albeit more expensive, adheres well and offers excellent corrosion resistance and durability. Investing in steel with quality paint ensures longevity, reduced maintenance, and an appealing appearance. Prioritising high-quality paint avoids the risks associated with lower quality alternatives, preserving the structural integrity and aesthetic appeal of the steel in the long run.

3.  Non-adherence to testing standards -

When purchasing lower quality steel, one of the significant concerns is the non-adherence to testing standards. Reputable manufacturers follow rigorous testing protocols to ensure that their steel meets specific industry requirements and standards. However, with lower quality steel, there is a higher likelihood of non-compliance with these essential testing standards.

This lack of adherence to testing standards poses several risks and uncertainties. Firstly, it becomes challenging to determine the actual properties and characteristics of the steel, making it difficult to assess its suitability for the intended application. Secondly, without reliable test data, it is impossible to accurately evaluate factors such as load-bearing capacity, corrosion resistance, or fire resistance. Consequently, using such non-tested steel in critical structures or projects can compromise the safety and integrity of the entire system.

4.  Performance in Challenging Environments -

Different applications require steel with specific properties to perform optimally in challenging environments. For instance, steel used in marine applications should have excellent corrosion resistance, while steel used in extreme temperature conditions must possess high thermal stability.

The lowest priced steel may not have the necessary attributes to withstand these demanding conditions. Corrosion resistance, for example, may be compromised due to the absence of specific alloying elements or inadequate protective coatings. Consequently, the cost savings from purchasing low-priced steel may be negated by premature deterioration, maintenance expenses, or even safety hazards.

5.  Lack of sales and after-sales support -

One of the most prominent challenges associated with purchasing low-cost metal is the limited resources and assistance provided by the supplier. The lower price often comes at the expense of support and customer service, leading to potential issues and frustrations.

Low-cost suppliers frequently have uneducated or unhelpful sales representatives who may lack the necessary knowledge and expertise to address customer inquiries effectively. This can result in a lack of guidance or assistance when encountering quality or processing issues with the metal sheet or coil products. Additionally, these suppliers often lack a dedicated technical department to provide support for installation questions, engineering requirements, warranties, project bidding, and other technical aspects.

This absence of expert guidance can lead to confusion and difficulties in navigating complex projects. Furthermore, low-cost suppliers typically offer little to no complimentary value-added services. These services could include valuable resources such as a take-off service, marketing support, architectural assistance, colour visualisation tools, and more. The absence of these services limits the overall support and value that can be derived from the supplier.

Purchasing lower cost material or opting for a low-cost material supplier can result in significant long-term financial losses. Moreover, risking your reputation by choosing materials solely based on their low price is not a wise decision.

When in the market for industrial materials, it is crucial to conduct thorough research and gain knowledge about various manufacturers and suppliers, and available options. By understanding the differences and assessing the offerings of different suppliers, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your business needs and requirements.

Exercise your best judgement when

selecting a supplier

that not only provides competitive pricing but also demonstrates reliability, quality, and a commitment to customer satisfaction."

Discover their uses, benefits, and load-bearing capabilities for modern building projects.",Business,3 Mins,all-about-the-i-beams-in-construction,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"The I beam stands as the most frequently utilised beam in the construction of structural steel. Its design and composition play a vital role in enabling the I beam to effectively support diverse heavy loads.

The I beam, also referred to as H, W, wide, universal beam, or rolled joist, is a

structural steel

shape commonly employed in building construction. Its primary function is to serve as a supportive element within structures. These beams possess the ability to endure diverse loads and maintain their structural integrity.

Design of an I Beam

I beams are created through the assembly of two elongated planes known as flanges, which are connected by a perpendicular component called the web. This structural member possesses a cross-section in the shape of either an I or an H.

In addition to steel, I beams can also be manufactured using aluminum alloys and low alloy steels to cater to different purposes such as bridges and building frames. I beams are produced in a variety of dimensions, thicknesses, widths, and other specifications to accommodate diverse applications.

Ensure compliance and quality in your operations.",Business,3 Mins,iso-certification-9000-versus-9001-what-is-the-difference-iso-certifications,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is a globally recognised and independent organisation that develops international standards for various industries. These standards cover areas such as quality, safety, and procedures.

In the steel industry, an ISO certification serves as proof that a company's management systems, manufacturing processes, services, or documentation procedures adhere to global quality assurance standards.

Continue reading to understand the significance of ISO certification and the distinctions between ISO certifications - 9000 and 9001.

What does an ISO certification mean?

The ISO plays a crucial role in establishing operational procedures across a wide range of industries. But what does this actually entail?

ISO guidelines assist businesses and organisations in effectively meeting the needs of their customers and stakeholders by ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements related to their products and services.

Essentially, ISO standards help companies assess whether they are conducting their operations correctly. It's important to note that the ISO solely focuses on creating and defining standards. To maintain objectivity, they engage third-party organisations to assess and evaluate companies seeking certifications.

In other words, while the ISO sets the standards, it is third-party groups that assess companies to determine if they have met the ISO guidelines necessary for obtaining ISO certifications.

The four major families of ISO Standards are-

1.      ISO 9000: Quality management systems

2.      ISO 14000: Environmental management systems

3.      ISO 26000: Guidance on social responsibility

4.      ISO 31000: Risk management principles and guidelines

What is ISO 9000?

ISO 9000 is a set of quality management standards widely applied in industries such as manufacturing and construction. It offers a comprehensive framework for its various subgroups by defining the fundamental principles and terminologies related to quality management systems. The ISO 9000 standards revolve around seven key principles of quality management, including customer focus, leadership, employee engagement, process-oriented approach, continual improvement, evidence-based decision-making, and relationship management.

What is ISO 9001?

ISO 9001, which is the primary subgroup of the ISO 9000 family and the sole provider of certification, establishes the criteria for achieving quality management standards across various aspects of an organisation. These encompass management functions, manufacturing processes, services, and documentation procedures. To fulfill these requirements, an organisation must-

1.  	Exhibit a consistent ability to deliver products and services that meet the defined customer, statutory, and regulatory requirements.

2.  	Continuously enhance customer satisfaction through ongoing process improvement and adherence to customer, statutory, and regulatory obligations.

This standard incorporates various principles of quality management, including prioritising customer satisfaction, engaging top management in the process, adopting a systematic approach to operations, and striving for continuous improvement.

Key differences between ISO 9000 and ISO 9001

1.

Scope:

ISO 9000 provides guidelines and principles for quality management, whereas ISO 9001 sets specific requirements for a quality management system.

2.

Certification:

ISO 9000 cannot be certified, as it is not a specific standard. On the other hand, ISO 9001 certification demonstrates that an organisation has met the requirements of the ISO 9001 standard and has implemented an effective quality management system.

3.

Focus:

ISO 9000 focuses on providing a common understanding and language for quality management, while ISO 9001 emphasiSes the implementation of quality management systems to meet customer and regulatory requirements.

Learn their applications and use cases in different industries for informed material decisions.,Product,3 MIns,difference-between-cold-rolled-and-cold-drawn-steel-applications-and-use,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Steel is ubiquitous in various applications, from construction and infrastructure to manufacturing and engineering. It is a robust and durable material that can be formed into various shapes and sizes to suit different needs. However, there are different types of steel, each with its own unique properties and production methods.

Two common types of steel are cold-rolled and cold-drawn steel, each with its own distinct characteristics and uses.

Cold Rolled Steel

Cold rolled steel

is a type of steel that is processed at room temperature, also known as ""cold reduction.""

The process involves passing the steel through rollers at room temperature to reduce its thickness and improve its surface finish. Cold rolling produces a smooth, flat surface with tight tolerances and excellent dimensional accuracy. Cold-rolled steel is commonly used in applications requiring a high-quality finish, such as automotive parts, appliances, and consumer goods.

One of the main benefits of cold-rolled steel is its strength. Because the steel is processed at room temperature, it retains its inherent strength and toughness, making it an ideal choice for structural applications such as building frames and bridges. Cold-rolled steel also has a high tensile strength, which means it can withstand significant stress and pressure without deforming or breaking.

Cold-rolled steel

is available in various grades and alloys, each with its specific properties and uses. Some common grades of cold rolled steel include commercial steel, drawing steel, and deep drawing steel. Commercial steel is the most common type of cold-rolled steel used in various applications, including automotive parts, construction, and appliances.

Drawing steel is used in applications that require good formability, such as automotive body parts. In contrast, deep drawing steel is used in applications that require high elongation and a uniform surface finish, such as cooking utensils and appliances.

Cold-Drawn Steel

Cold-drawn steel is another type of steel that is processed at room temperature. However, unlike cold-rolled steel, which is flattened through rollers, cold-drawn steel is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. The process involves pulling the steel through the die using a mandrel, which ensures the steel maintains its shape and dimensional accuracy. Cold-drawn steel is known for its excellent surface finish and dimensional accuracy. It has a smooth, polished surface with tight tolerances and uniformity in diameter.

Cold-drawn steel is commonly used in applications that require precise dimensional accuracy, such as shafts, pins, and fasteners. One of the key benefits of cold-drawn steel is its ability to improve the material's mechanical properties. The drawing process aligns the steel grains, improving their strength and ductility. Cold-drawn steel also has a higher yield strength than cold-rolled steel, which makes it more suitable for applications that require high strength and toughness.

Applications and Use Cases

Cold rolled steel

1. Building and Construction:

Cold rolled steel is used extensively in the building and construction industry. It is commonly used in the production of structural components such as beams, columns, and joists. Additionally, cold rolled steel is used to make roofing, siding, and gutters. Its strength, durability, and resistance to corrosion make it suitable for use in harsh environments.

2. Appliances:

5RN6qjcMKwInjvOJDYv7sh,What are the structural loads that affect steel frame buildings,Unveiling the Structural Loads Impacting Steel Frame Buildings | JSW One MSME Blog,Uncover the diverse structural loads affecting steel frame buildings and how they are considered in the design and construction process for optimal structural integrity.,Business,3 Months,what-are-the-structural-loads-that-affect-steel-frame-buildings,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Steel frame buildings have become increasingly popular in modern construction due to their exceptional strength, durability, and versatility. One of the key factors contributing to their robustness is their ability to withstand various structural loads. Understanding these loads is crucial for engineers, architects, and construction professionals designing and constructing steel frame buildings.

In this article, we will understand the different types of structural loads that affect steel frame buildings and explore how these loads are accounted for in the design process.

What are structural loads?

Structural loads, which encompass deformations, accelerations, and external forces, are technical terms used to describe the factors that can impact the stability of a structure. These loads need to be considered when dealing with the construction of steel frame buildings.

While you may have experience with structural loads in constructing buildings using other materials, it is essential to note that the structural loads affecting steel frame buildings are unique and require specific consideration.

This is due to the different load thresholds associated with fabricated steel. Safety should always be a top priority, so it is crucial to thoroughly research and adhere to the relevant regulations and guidelines for the safe erection of steel frame buildings.

Types of structural loads

1. Dead Load

The dead load refers to the weight of the building's permanent components, such as the steel structure, floors, walls, roof, and fixed equipment. Since steel is a relatively lightweight material, the dead load is typically lower than other construction materials. Accurate estimation of the dead load is essential to ensure the structural integrity and stability of the building.

2. Live Load

The live load represents the transient loads that vary over time and result from the occupancy and use of the building. It includes the weight of people, furniture, equipment, and any movable loads. The magnitude of the live load depends on the building's function. For instance, an office building will have a different live load requirement than a warehouse. Engineers consider safety codes and regulations to determine the appropriate live load capacity to be incorporated into the steel frame design.

3. Snow Load

In regions that experience heavy snowfall, snow load becomes a significant consideration. The weight of accumulated snow on the roof and other horizontal surfaces of a building can exert considerable pressure on the structure. Engineers must account for the snow load in the design by considering factors such as the geographic location, the average snowfall in the region, and the shape and slope of the roof.

4. Wind Load

Wind load is one of the most critical to consider in steel frame building design. The force exerted by the wind on the building depends on factors such as wind speed, direction, duration, and the building's shape, height, and exposure. Engineers use wind tunnel testing, computer simulations, and mathematical models to assess the wind loads on different parts of the structure and ensure the building can withstand them. Techniques such as bracing and adding shear walls enhance the building's resistance to wind forces.

5. Seismic Load

Steel frame buildings must be designed to withstand seismic loads in earthquake-prone regions. Earthquakes generate powerful ground motions that can cause significant lateral forces on the structure. Engineers employ specialised design techniques such as base isolation and structural damping to mitigate the impact of seismic forces. These methods help dissipate the energy generated during an earthquake and minimise the potential for structural damage.

6. Thermal Load

Thermal loads are caused by temperature variations resulting in building materials' expansion and contraction. Steel has a relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion, meaning it expands and contracts more than other construction materials. Engineers must consider thermal loads to ensure proper design detailing, accommodating thermal movement and preventing excessive stresses that could compromise the integrity of the steel frame.

7. Blast Load

In high-security or sensitive buildings, blast loads become a crucial consideration. Blast loads arise from the detonation of explosive devices and can cause severe damage to structures. Steel frame buildings can be designed to withstand blast loads by incorporating blast-resistant materials, reinforcing connections, and utilising specialised design principles to dissipate and redirect the energy from the blast.

Steel frame buildings are engineered to withstand various structural loads, ensuring their durability and safety over time. It is highly unlikely for a steel frame building to encounter only one of the above types of structural loads at any given time. Considering the various loads acting on the structure simultaneously is crucial. Depending on the combination and magnitude of these loads, there can be a significant potential for damage to the building.By accounting for these loads and employing advanced engineering techniques, architects and engineers can create

amazing structures that will last generations.

One of the most coveted finishes for stainless steel surfaces is the mirror finish, which provides a glossy, reflective appearance. Achieving a mirror finish requires careful preparation, attention to detail, and the right techniques.

In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of achieving a mirror finish on

stainless steel.

1. Understanding Stainless Steel and its Characteristics

Stainless steel is an alloy composed of iron, chromium, and other elements, such as nickel and molybdenum. The exact composition may vary depending on the specific grade of stainless steel. The addition of chromium creates a protective layer of chromium oxide on the surface of the steel, which gives stainless steel its exceptional corrosion resistance.

Different grades of stainless steel have varying amounts of chromium and other alloying elements, resulting in different properties. Some grades are more suitable for achieving a mirror finish due to their enhanced polishability. For example, austenitic stainless steels, such as 304 and 316, are commonly used for their excellent corrosion resistance and polishability. Ferritic and martensitic stainless steels are generally less suitable for achieving a mirror finish due to their lower chromium content and higher hardness.

Understanding the composition and properties of the specific grade of stainless steel you are working with is crucial in selecting the right approach and techniques for achieving a mirror finish. It helps determine the appropriate polishing compounds, equipment, and processes that will yield the best results.

2. Surface Preparation

Proper surface preparation is vital for achieving a mirror finish on stainless steel. The surface must be clean, free from contaminants, oils, and residues that can interfere with the polishing process. Surface preparation typically involves a combination of cleaning, sanding, and grinding.

Cleaning the stainless steel surface thoroughly using suitable cleaning agents removes dirt, grease, and other impurities. It is important to use cleaners that are specifically formulated for stainless steel to avoid damaging the surface. After cleaning, the surface may be passivated to remove any embedded iron particles and restore the protective chromium oxide layer.

Sanding and grinding techniques are then employed to eliminate scratches, imperfections, and unevenness. Starting with coarser grits, such as 120 or 180, and gradually progressing to finer ones, such as 320, 400, and beyond, helps achieve a smoother surface. The use of sanding discs, belts, or abrasive pads in conjunction with sanding machines or hand tools ensures consistent and controlled material removal.

Surface preparation is a critical step as it ensures that the subsequent polishing stages are effective and yield the desired mirror finish. It creates a clean and uniform base for the polishing compounds to work on, enhancing the overall results.

3. Polishing Process

The polishing process plays a crucial role in achieving a mirror finish on stainless steel. It involves the progressive removal of material from the surface while simultaneously refining it to a high level of smoothness and reflectivity. Here are the key steps involved in the polishing process:

Rough Polishing: In the initial stages, a coarse polishing compound is used to remove any remaining scratches or imperfections from the surface. This step helps to smoothen the surface and prepares it for the subsequent polishing stages.

Intermediate Polishing: As the process progresses, finer polishing compounds are employed to further refine the surface and enhance its shine. This step involves using polishing wheels or pads with increasingly finer abrasives to achieve a smoother finish.

Final Polishing: In the final stages of the polishing process, ultra-fine polishing compounds are utilized to achieve the desired mirror finish. These compounds contain very fine abrasives that remove any remaining imperfections and bring out the maximum shine and reflectivity of the stainless steel surface.

The polishing process requires skill, precision, and patience. It is essential to maintain consistent pressure, speed, and contact with the polishing wheel or pad to ensure uniform results. The process may need to be repeated several times, using different polishing compounds, until the desired mirror finish is achieved.

4. Polishing Techniques

4.1 Mechanical Polishing: Mechanical polishing is a widely used technique for achieving a mirror finish on stainless steel. It involves the use of abrasive materials, such as polishing wheels, belts, or discs, along with polishing compounds. The polishing compounds, also known as buffing compounds, contain fine abrasives suspended in a binder.

The process begins with the selection of the appropriate polishing wheel or pad, considering factors such as the desired finish, surface area, and accessibility. The wheel or pad is attached to a polishing machine, which can be handheld or mounted on a benchtop. The stainless steel surface is then brought into contact with the rotating polishing wheel, and pressure is applied to facilitate material removal and polishing.

The choice of polishing compounds depends on the specific requirements of the stainless steel grade and the desired finish. Compounds with finer abrasives are used for the final stages to achieve a high level of shine and reflectivity. The polishing process is typically performed in multiple stages, starting with coarser compounds and gradually transitioning to finer ones.

4.2 Electropolishing: Electropolishing is an electrochemical process that is highly effective in achieving a mirror finish on stainless steel. It involves immersing the stainless steel object in an electrolyte solution and applying a direct current. The electrolyte consists of a mixture of acids and salts, which help remove surface imperfections and promote the formation of a smooth, passive layer.

5. Finishing Touches

Once the mirror finish is achieved, there are a few additional steps you can take to enhance and protect the surface of the stainless steel:

Cleaning and Degreasing: After the polishing process, it is crucial to thoroughly clean the stainless steel surface to remove any residue or polishing compounds. This can be done using a mild detergent or stainless steel cleaner, followed by rinsing with water and drying with a soft cloth.

Protective Coating: Applying a protective coating or sealant to the mirror-finished stainless steel surface can help maintain its shine and protect it from fingerprints, smudges, and corrosion. There are various types of protective coatings available, including clear lacquers and nano-coatings specifically designed for stainless steel.

Ongoing Maintenance: To keep the mirror finish looking its best, regular maintenance is essential. This includes gentle cleaning with non-abrasive cleaners and microfiber cloths, avoiding harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could scratch the surface. Additionally, using stainless steel polishes or sprays can help restore shine and remove any minor blemishes.

By following these steps, you can achieve a stunning mirror finish on stainless steel and ensure its long-lasting beauty. Whether you are working on small stainless steel objects or larger architectural structures, understanding the polishing process and giving attention to the finishing touches will help you achieve outstanding results.

6. Troubleshooting and Common Challenges

Achieving a mirror finish on stainless steel can sometimes pose certain challenges. Here are some common issues that may arise during the process and possible troubleshooting steps:

Scratches and Blemishes: Despite careful polishing, scratches or blemishes may still appear on the stainless steel surface. In such cases, reevaluating the polishing technique and using finer abrasives or adjusting the pressure may help minimize or eliminate these imperfections.

Uneven Surface: Unevenness or waviness on the surface can occur if there is inconsistent pressure or inadequate polishing in certain areas. To rectify this, ensure consistent pressure and movement during the polishing process, and pay close attention to all sections of the stainless steel surface.

Overheating: Overheating can result in discoloration or warping of the stainless steel. It is important to use moderate speeds and avoid excessive pressure or dwell time during the polishing process to prevent overheating. Cooling agents or intermittent polishing can also help manage heat buildup.

Streaks and Smudges: Streaks or smudges may appear on the surface due to inadequate cleaning or improper handling during the polishing process. To address this, thoroughly clean the surface before polishing, use clean and lint-free cloths or pads, and handle the stainless steel with gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints or oils.

Troubleshooting any challenges during the mirror finishing process requires patience and experimentation. It is crucial to identify the underlying cause and adjust the polishing technique accordingly to achieve the desired results.

4L1P7qvdqWS4h0xiSx23eH,How to check the quality of cement before you begin construction?,Ensuring Cement Quality: Pre-Construction Checks and Tips | JSW One MSME Blog,Discover essential steps to assess cement quality before starting construction. Learn how to evaluate cement properties for a durable and successful building project.,Business,3 Mins,how-to-check-the-quality-of-cement-before-you-begin-construction,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Cement is a crucial component in the construction industry, used in various applications such as building foundations, walls, floors, and roads. It is a binding material that is vital in providing structural strength to the construction. However, not all cement is of the same quality, and using inferior-quality cement can result in a weak and unsafe structure.

Therefore, ensuring that the cement used in any construction project is of good quality is essential. Let’s take a look at how to check cement quality at construction sites.

1.Check cement manufacturing date  -

It is crucial to check the production date of cement on the packaging before using it, as many people need to be made aware that cement gradually loses its strength over time. This is because fresh cement quickly absorbs moisture from the air, even when tightly packed in a bag, resulting in increased moisture content and chemical reactions known as 'hydration'. Therefore, it is recommended by most experts to use cement within 90 days of manufacturing to ensure optimal strength and quality.

As cement ages, it experiences a decline in strength, with reductions ranging from 20% to 30% after three months, 30% to 40% after six months, and 40% to 50% after a year. It is essential to understand these effects to ensure the cement used in construction projects meets the required standards for strength and durability.

2. Check the colour of the cement –

The colour of cement is a significant clue about its quality and composition. The preferred colour of cement is a consistent grey with a faint greenish tint. However, if the cement has a darker greenish hue, it might indicate an excessive amount of lime or clay.

3. Check for the presence of lumps -

It is crucial to examine the contents to ensure no clumps inside. The presence of lumps signifies that the cement bag has been exposed to moisture. As mentioned earlier, moisture weakens the cement, rendering it ineffective.

If you find lumps in the cement bag, it is essential to reject it and contact the supplier or manufacturer.

4. Cement float test -

To ensure that cement has not been contaminated with excessive dust, which could weaken it, you can conduct a straightforward float test at the building site. To do this, take a handful of cement from the bag and toss it into a bucket of water.

Good quality cement will float on the water for a period before sinking, whereas cement containing impurities will sink right away. Conversely, cement mixed with dust will remain afloat for an extended period.

5. Cement adulteration test -

To determine the quality of cement, you can take a small amount of the material and rub it between your fingers. If the texture is smooth, it is of good quality. However, if the cement feels rough or grainy, it could indicate an excessive amount of sand in the mixture.

6. Cement temperature test -

All you need to do is to insert your clean and dry hand into the cement bag. If the material feels cool, it means that hydration has not occurred yet. But, if it feels warm, it indicates that the cement has already reacted with moisture and started hardening, making it unusable for construction purposes.

7. Cement odour test -

One method to determine the quality of cement involves using your sense of smell. Normally, cement does not have a discernible scent. But if you detect an earthy odour emanating from the bag, it may suggest the presence of an excessive amount of clay and sand in the cement mixture.

8. Cement setting test -

Lastly, you can assess cement quality by preparing a thick paste with water and spreading it onto a glass plate. Mix roughly 100 gm of cement with a small amount of water to ensure the paste is firm. Then, using a trowel, make a cement cake with straight edges and submerge the glass plate into a bucket of water.

Let the plate stay underwater for around 24 hours before removing it. If the shape of the cement cake looks unchanged and there are no visible cracks or uneven edges, it indicates that the cement is of good quality.

2sYDR8694l1vDuumekHdA1,5 corrosion prevention methods for MSMEs catering to the automotive sector,5 Types of Corrosion Prevention Methods | JSW One MSME Blog,Corrosion is the silent killer for small businesses in the automotive sector. Read our blog to know about 5 types of corrosion prevention methods!,Business,3 Mins,article,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Did you know that corrosion is responsible for over $2.5 trillion in annual losses to auto businesses, worldwide? According to a study by The International Measures of Prevention, Application, and Economics of Corrosion Technology (IMPACT), losses due to corrosion include lost revenue, labour, and productivity for companies, resulting in annual losses to the tune of 3% of the world’s total GDP (as of June 2022).

This disquieting statistic assumes particular significance if you are an MSME supplying auto parts and components, because corrosion alone could be responsible for eroding your margins by as much as 35% annually. A report by

NACE Impact

places the potential cost savings by implementing best practices to control rusting at anywhere between 15% and 35% of net production costs.

Corrosion is often referred to as the silent killer. And for small businesses in the automotive sector, its dangers are all too real.

Business losses due to corrosion – A closer look

As individuals, most of us are resigned to the phenomenon of rusting damaging our vehicles, our electronic equipment and devices with metallic components. Corrosion creeps up on us quietly, and the only way to prevent it from happening is by opting for expensive anti-rusting coating or chemical treatments.

For MSMEs dealing in production of automotive components and automobile parts, however, corrosion is more than a nuisance. Left unchecked, it can wipe out entire businesses. While most businesses factor abstracted losses due to part corrosion as part of their operating costs (wear and tear), these estimates are often conservative and do not reflect the true scale of the losses. In addition, significant losses can accrue due to one-off adverse events -

Losses due to recalls and cancelled orders -

Corroded parts can result in recalls and cancelled orders, impacting your revenue forecasts and damaging your firm’s reputation irrevocably.

Lost inventory due to corrosion –

Parts stored in warehouse inventory, or delayed in transit are likely to be affected by rusting, resulting in significant losses to the firm.

Losses due to repairs

– MSMEs committing to repair damage due to rust (instead of discarding the inventory) are likely to find themselves footing a costly bill that would eat into their quarterly earnings.

Legal costs –

Even with limited liability arrangements, MSMEs are at risk of legal action initiative by the OEM, client, or end customer if QC fails and a batch of corroded automotive components is supplied.

The operational losses due to corrosion for a business depends on several factors, including -

The type of product (for example, if it is an automobile or an industrial machine)

The type of material being used (for example, steel or iron)

The environmental conditions (for example, moisture or air pollution)

The type of operation that caused the corrosion (for example, rusting caused by rainwater).

It is clear that preventive measures are a must to deal with the problem of rusting at scale. But what can you do, as an MSME? Let’s take a closer look at the phenomenon to find an answer.

Why does corrosion occur – and what are its early warning signs?

Corrosion occurs because of steel's natural tendency to rust. It is the result of an electrochemical reaction, in which metal wears away when it comes into contact with an acidic or a basic substance. The process is accelerated by the presence of water in the environment; humidity promotes the formation of rust, which can then attack other components. Once the corrosion takes hold, it is difficult to detect any symptoms until a part fractures or fails. Nevertheless, there are tell-tale signs that indicate the onset of corrosion -

1. Rusting -

Rust is a reddish-brown discolouration that is often the first sign that a vehicle or component is suffering from corrosion. It is caused by road salt, acid rain, and other environmental factors.

2. Paint discoloration -

Peeling, fading, or flaking of paint is another early sign that the metal has started to corrode.

Five techniques for MSMEs to prevent corrosion and achieve cost savings

1.Invest into magnesium-based corrosion protection solutions

Magnesium is a wonder metal for combatting the ill-effects of corrosion. It can be used as part of an anti-corrosion solution or as a corrosion protection solution.

When used as an anti-corrosion solution, magnesium is added directly to the water that is being used to clean the vehicle. This prevents calcium and other minerals from reacting with the metal components inside the vehicle, which would cause them to rust if left untreated.

When used as a corrosion protection solution, magnesium must be applied before any damage has occurred, since it is meant as a preventive measure. Magnesium Corrosion and Corrosion Protection Solutions provide protection against both galvanic and thermal degradation caused by exposure to water, oxygen-containing gases (such as exhaust fumes), and acids like sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid found in brake fluids.

2.Reducing the galvanic corrosion between carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer and metal

Carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are used in the automotive industry to make parts lighter and more durable. However, this property can also be a source of corrosion. Carbon fibre-reinforced polymers have a similar composition to steel, which makes them susceptible to galvanic corrosion. It can lead to cracks in the material and structural failure. The resulting damage can be costly if not caught early on during production or repair work on an automobile body or chassis.

To prevent galvanic corrosion between carbon fibre-reinforced polymers and metals, manufacturers must consider the following:

Make sure that the metal surface is properly cleaned and free of any deposits or other contaminants

Use thermal spray coating on the metal surfaces, when possible, as this can help prevent corrosion from starting in the first place

Use stainless steel fasteners whenever possible

3.

Using lab-to-field correlation and corrosion standards for new materials

Some companies have developed a method called Lab-to-field correlation, which starts with actual lab tests performed on new materials before they are put into cars. This allows them to know exactly how much of their new material has been affected by corrosion so that they can make adjustments as necessary.

To prevent corrosion in automobiles, it is important to follow a process of correlation and standardization. Corrosion standards can also be used as a reference point for measuring the performance of materials in different environments.

By using this technique many uncertainties (including corrosion susceptibility) involved in

various stages like testing to the product launch can be minimised.

4.Using simulation models to accurately predict corrosion

In a simulation, the component is not exposed directly to corrosive salts. Instead, it is first coated with a protective layer (e.g., epoxy) and then placed in an environment that simulates that in which it will be used. The protective coating prevents any contact with corrosive agents until after it has been exposed to these agents. Once exposed, however, it is subject to corrosion by these agents and must be removed or replaced before it can be used again.

They are faster than salt spray tests because no actual corrosion occurs during testing; instead, only changes occur in surface properties over time due to exposure (i.e., erosion/oxidation).

5.Leverage new technologies in the auto industry to stay ahead of corrosive damage

The technology used to manufacture vehicles has evolved significantly, and so has the potential for preventing steel corrosion. Automobiles now incorporate a significant number of ""smart"" functions such as tire pressure monitoring and other intelligent diagnostic systems that have become an industry standard; corrosion monitoring systems are currently under research and may find their way into the automotive sector within the next decade.

For example, the usage of sensors, with the potential for real-time monitoring of corrosion rates at critical locations, could provide warnings before critical system failure. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and machine learning may help collate field corrosion data leading to more accurate lab-to-field correlation.

Prevention, as they say, is always better than the cure – automotive MSMEs can benefit by adopting these best practices. With adequate precautions, investment into the latest anti-corrosion technologies, and the right engineering, corrosion does not have to be a small business killer.

Read on to know more about how digitisation has enabled the steel sellers to evolve better.,News,3 mins,the-digitisation-of-steel-changing-the-industry-for-the-better,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Customer tastes are rapidly changing and this is not the case in just retail. Of course, retail customers tend to be more vocal about their feelings regarding their interaction with a brand. Conversely, the way consumer brands scramble to deliver more positive experiences has become obvious to even casual industry observers. The process of tailoring more engaging user experiences may be less noticeable in other sectors. 

This doesn’t mean meeting customer expectations in B2B relationships is less of a challenge for marketers. Take the steel industry for instance. This is not a commodity any more in customers’ minds.

Rising expectations of steel users

Online steel buyers look for steel treated at different temperatures and with a wide range of surface finishes. There is demand for steel slit into various lengths and widths as well as with different tensile strengths. More than ever before, MSMEs want the flexibility to order steel in small quantities and need a trusted steel supplier to work with. This also means that fair, transparent pricing is vital for online steel buyers since it takes much of the worry out of business deals. Plus, a lot of customers expect their orders to be fulfilled quickly.

The way ahead is digitisation

For all of the above to happen efficiently and at scale, online steel sellers must evolve into something akin to a

one-stop steel marketplace

- an all encompassing e-commerce portal that meets buyers’ expectations. To boost customer satisfaction, these online steel sellers must start digitising now, if they haven’t already.  


In the past, different steel works have typically operated in silos, isolated from the rest of the organisation. Sharing of data across such entities wasn’t considered a priority. Today, data is the new oil fueling the information society we inhabit. Accurate information picked out of raw enterprise data can potentially help a steel marketer make a difference in a highly competitive marketplace. 

The key differentials that CXOs in the steel economy hold close to their hearts are improved customer satisfaction, lowered operating costs, waste reduction, and, of course, more encouraging margins. The “Smart steel factory” is the solution.

The smart steel factory – It’s about time

There is no universally agreed definition of a smart factory and no two of these factories are going to look the same. However, the common denominator is that smart steel factory environments can help steel makers derive more meaning from their streams of enterprise data. This insight will, in turn, help them lower the time spent in producing an item, reduce operational costs and minimise defects.

Smart steel factories are backed by a massive network of IoTs (e.g., sensors) and applications, which generate a constant stream of data. Shop floor sensors will continuously monitor machines to measure their current state of health and anticipate breakdowns before they can occur. This will improve productivity, product quality as well as the safety of employees. Machine-learning algorithms are applied to massive volumes of such IoT data to discover hidden patterns and project future trends for the company.

What’s in it for MSMEs

A smart steel factory is a digitised manufacturing facility and smart factories across locations come together into an integrated infrastructure. Steel producers can leverage this connected infrastructure to drive efficiency across all business functions, from raw material procurement to warehousing operations. Drawing on the e-commerce playbook, steel stock yards will operate like an e-commerce giant’s automated warehouse. This will reduce the lead time for customers, including MSMEs.

The smart infrastructure will provide MSMEs with a single touchpoint for “all things steel.” With this, they can login to a portal, search for a type of steel, and buy steel online. Like any e-commerce user, they can order steel online, choose their preferred payment mode and track their shipments in real time.

639DqsaBzHZYY1aBfWIU25,Role of nickel in stainless steel,What is the Role of Nickel in Stainless Steel | JSW One MSME Blog,"Nickel containing stainless steel have properties like formability, weldability, toughness and more. Read our blog to know in detail the properties of nickel-containing stainless steel!",Product,3 Mins,role-of-nickel-in-stainless-steel,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"For over a century, stainless steel has been used in many products. It is made up of various iron-based alloys. However, unlike traditional steel, they are not susceptible to corrosion and do not rust when only exposed to water. Chromium is the alloying component that gives the steel its ""stainless"" quality, while nickel is what makes

stainless steel

such a versatile alloy.

Nickel-containing stainless steels have an inherent resistance to corrosion in addition to being simple to shape and weld, ductile at shallow temperatures, and suitable for high-temperature applications. Additionally, they are not magnetic, unlike ordinary steel and stainless steel without nickel. This implies that they can be transformed into a remarkable variety of goods, with usage in the chemical business, the health industry, and residential uses. In fact, nickel is so crucial that 75% of stainless steel manufacturing comprises gra containing nickel. The two with the most nickel are Type 316, which has 11% nickel, and Type 304, which has 8% nickel.

The properties of nickel-containing stainless steel:-

1.Formability -

Stainless steels benefit from excellent formability and ductility thanks to the austenitic structure. The popular Type 304, which contains 8% nickel and 18% chromium, exhibits good stretch-forming properties. A slightly higher nickel concentration would improve the austenite's stability further and lessen its propensity to work hard, making it more suitable for deep drawing. Unlike low-nickel, high-manganese alloys, these alloys are not prone to delayed cold cracking. Due to their outstanding formability, 300-series austenitic alloys are frequently employed for products like cooking pots and sinks.

2.Weldability -

The welding process is used to create a lot of stainless steel equipment. Generally, austenitic nickel alloys, of which Types 304 and 316 are the most often fabricated stainless steels in the world, are better for welding than other alloys. They don't tend to become brittle like ferritic alloys because of high-temperature grain development, and the welds have great bend and impact qualities. Both thick and thin portions can be easily welded together.

3.Toughness -

A material's capacity to absorb energy without breaking is crucial in many engineering applications. At standard temperature, most stainless steels are fairly durable. Still, as the temperature drops, the ferritic structure becomes increasingly more brittle, making ferritic stainless steel unsuitable for cryogenic temperatures. Grades like Type 304 are frequently utilised for cryogenic applications since standard austenitic stainless steels maintain good toughness even at liquid helium temperatures (-270oC).

4.High-temperature properties -

The austenitic alloys of stainless steel that contain nickel have much more muscular high-temperature strength than other alloys, especially when it comes to their capacity to withstand creep or the tendency to move slowly or permanently deform under mechanical forces. Additionally, these alloys are far less likely to develop destructive brittle phases when subjected to temperatures higher than 300oC. During thermal cycling, nickel decreases spalling and stabilises the protective oxide covering. For applications requiring high temperatures and fire resistance, austenitic alloys are used.

5.Sustainability -

After a product's useful life, most nickel-containing materials are completely recyclable; their high value stimulates recycling. In turn, this reduces the demand for virgin resources and the energy required for their manufacturing, which stainless steels that include nickel. For instance, scrap stainless steel saves the energy needed to make stainless steel by around one-third compared to using only virgin materials.

6.Ease of production

- The end user may not necessarily see production ease right away. However, due to the widespread use, versatility, and scale of production of the major austenitic alloys, they are now readily and affordably available in all sizes, shapes, and locations worldwide. The majority of the primary nickel stockpile in the world is used to make stainless steel. The presence of chromium is primarily responsible for stainless steel's ""stainless"" property, but nickel is also a crucial component. The metal needs nickel to resist corrosion, which enables it to tolerate high temperatures. Steel's resistance to acid reduction is improved by nickel's ability to reduce corrosion rate. Nickel is present in more than half of the annual tonnage of stainless steel produced."
326U7ZGS1WklYg5LhWiKuY,Advantages of Cold Rolled Steel,Cold Rolled Steel | Cold Rolled Coil | JSW One MSME Blog,"Discover the benefits of cold rolled steel like increased strength, improved surface finish, and more. Find quality cold rolled steel sheets and coils at JSW One MSME.",Product,3 Min,advantage-cold-rolled-steel,Read Now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Steel is roll-pressed at temperatures exceeding 1,700˚F, at which the 3-dimensional arrangement of atoms in the crystalline metal are permanently reoriented to increase ductility while lowering excess hardness. In this process, molten hot steel slabs are passed through a series of rotating rollers, which render the metal defect-free and the stock is compressed into desired shapes and dimensions. The metal is then left to cool. The resulting material is “hot rolled” steel. This steel has a myriad of applications across industries.

There are many steel products and parts that require steel with precise dimensions and higher surface quality than

hot rolled steel

. With this in mind, existing hot-rolled steel is further compressed, squeezed, turned, precision ground, and polished into desired shapes and sizes. All of this happens at room temperature and only mechanical strength, no heat, is employed. The end product is a more refined material-

cold rolled steel

(or CR steel).

More strength

Unlike hot rolled steel,

CR steel

doesn’t undergo structural changes during its generation since its shape change is achieved without the use of any heat. At the same time, large rollers compress and roll the material, bringing intense pressure on it, hardening it in process. The result is that CR steel is able to withstand a significant amount of stress. Strength-wise, it outshines hot-rolled steel of the same grade by a margin of nearly 20%.

Improved surface finish

The cold rolling process also refines the inner structure of the metal and smoothens its surface, leaving it with an oily or greasy finish, depending again on the type of cold-rolling process applied. Compared to hot rolled steel, cold rolled steel presents buyers with a wider range of surface finishes and mechanical properties. Take, for instance, bright annealed (BA) finish.

BA finish is first cold rolled, then heated to a range between 1700˚F to 2100˚F, before being cooled. BA derives its smooth, bright, and reflective “mirror finish” from this annealing process.  Typically,

cold rolled sheets

have fewer surface blemishes than hot rolled ones, and, consequently, products shaped from cold rolled steel exhibit a clean and polished surface free of rust or oxide deposits. Moreover, this steel lends itself well to being painted and has increased corrosion resistance.

Tighter tolerance

Among other things, CR steel sheets come with tighter tolerance, an industry term indicative of the thickness of the material. The cold rolling process generates steel that is generally thinner, with closer dimensional tolerances, than the ones produced by hot rollers. With very high tight tolerance, steel tempered through the “full-hard cold rolling process” leads the way.

Full-hard cold rolling is capable of trimming the metal thickness by nearly half, which is remarkably high tolerance. Therefore, it is significant as an input material for products that require higher metal tolerances. That’s not all, cold rolled steel can be easily slit with very high precision to the desired length, its thickness suitably adjusted, and bends/curves fixed.

Common applications

Cold-rolled steel is used in applications where factors, such as medium-to-high tensile strengths, fine surface quality, flatness (straightness) and formability are paramount:

Automotive

Aerospace structural components

Civil engineering (e.g., steel sheds, industrial buildings, garages)

Home appliances

Metal furniture

Pipes and tubes, refrigeration tubes

Bear seals

Oil filters

Fire extinguishers

Since cold rolling involves more processing and consumes more resources, it carries a higher price than HR steel of the same grade. Besides, compared to hot rolled steel, it takes far more effort to deform CR steel and draw it into new shapes without breaking. However, some loss of ductility might be a small price to pay for increased hardness in scenarios where the latter is a more compelling need.

Read on to know more about the EV market!,Technology,3 mins,electric-vehicle-boom-in-india-opportunities-for-the-msmes-to-catalyse-the,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"The global electric vehicle (EV) market is developing at a rapid pace. As per the database of EV Volumes, the EV share worldwide has reached 8.3% in 2021 from 4.2% in 2020(1). A whopping 108% increase. EVs are garnering tremendous attention across the world as they are energy efficient and contribute to reducing urban air and noise pollution.  The EV market in India is also proliferating speedily. Currently, the Indian EV market is valued at around $ 220 Million (2020) and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 90% till 2030(2). The year 2021 accounted for a sale of around 0.32 million vehicles, a 168% growth YOY3.

Outlook: Next 5 years

EVs in India are gathering momentum and a lot of government policies are giving a boost to the domestic EV industry.

The 2021 PLI (production linked incentives) scheme of USD 12.6 Billion to incentivize the domestic production of lithium-ion batteries

The 2020 “Charging infrastructure for EV” guidelines for capping the per-unit cost for charging an EV at a public station

The 2019 FAME II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) scheme to generate EV demand with a focus on shared transport

It is expected that the 2W and 3W auto segment will spearhead the adoption curve followed by e-buses and passenger taxis, while 4Ws are likely to be the laggards owing to the gaps like high prices, low performance, and insufficient battery promise.

However, the transition is an excellent opportunity for India to become a hub of EV manufacturing at a global level.

The constituent blocks of building an EV are:

Motor: -

The electric motor draws energy from the battery and runs on the AC power to rotate the wheels.

Battery –

The EV battery is the electrical storage tank that stores the energy in the form of a DC current. It is laid out as a panel under the car belly.

DC-DC Converter

-

The converter distributes the power from the battery to a required level and provides the voltage required to charge the battery.

Semiconductors: -

Constitutes the computing backbone across all electronic systems in an EV. They are essential to performing critical functions like ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems), regenerative braking, cameras, emergency brakes, navigation, sensors, and much more.

Steel: An ubiquitous constituent for vehicular electrification

The switch toward EVs continues to be an important part of the automotive manufacturers’ sustainability plans. In that endeavor, steel is well-positioned to act as an important constituent in the transition towards vehicular electrification. Steel continues to remain the preferred material for EV body structure, closures, and battery enclosures. Its inherent strength and ductility make it the best suited for EV’s structural performance and battery packaging requirements. Steel also helps to achieve goals like cost efficiency, lightweight and sustainability benefits while meeting safety standards. As far as the main components of an electrical vehicle are concerned, steel is used as follows:

Motor: An electric motor depends on steel to propel a vehicle forward. The electrical steel used in electric motors is only 0.2-0.35 mm thick as compared to the material used in traditional electric motors (0.5-0.65 mm). Non-oriented electric steel is used in the making of an electric motor. This helps in the reduction of core losses which makes the electric motors more efficient.

Body: The EV body construction focuses majorly on four things – lightweight, cost-effectiveness, processing requirements, and sustainability in terms of recycling. If there is a material that fulfills all these conditions, it has to be steel. High-strength steel is an important basis for modern EV construction due to its strength and stiffness. It can reduce the weight of an EV by up to 40%.

Battery: - The battery casting has to be resilient to temperature, chemicals, and fire. The casting needs to provide crash safety and series production suitability for EV batteries. High-performance

stainless steel

helps automotive manufacturers to address these challenges. It offers a wide range of characteristics that resolves the issues related to the design and construction of an EV battery.

Way forward for the automotive manufacturers: OEMs and MSME

The majority of the automotive manufacturers and ancillary suppliers currently deal in the conventional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) landscape. However, the level of acceleration and innovation in the EV market of India warrants the OEMs and the MSMEs to adapt to the transformation. The EV landscape is going to remain an important contributor to India’s COP26 commitments and there is an opportunity for hundreds of entrepreneurs and organizations to be a part of India’s growth story. Some of such opportunities are:

Connectors and Sensors: -

The EV Sensors and connectors market is poised for breakout growth. Automotive manufacturers are integrating more sensors in their vehicles to meet the productivity demands of the customers. In addition, there is also a huge scope for improvement in traditional sensors and sensors mechanisms in order to increase vehicular performance and reliability. It is also expected that due to the implementation of BS-VI standards, the demand for sensors like oxygen sensors and battery sensors will also take off

Charging stations: -

EV charging stations are the quick wins as compared to the other opportunity segments. There are practically no operational expenses in the business of developing charging stations. As far as the setting up cost is concerned, that is also fairly low and no license is required to build an EV charging infrastructure. Hence, the expenses of setting up an EV charging infrastructure are very limited restricted to chargers, electricity, software, advertising, employees, and maintenance. MSMEs can also explore the franchise option where the investment is as low as INR 6-7 Lacs.

Expand the product portfolio and offerings: -

There are multiple ways to do this. MSMEs can expand their portfolio by integrating components like batteries, battery materials, electric motors, and power electronics into their portfolio, in addition to ancillaries like electric motors and forged wheels. The demand for such components is bound to surge with EV penetration. The other way to do so is the expand the after-market offerings like parking cameras, touchscreen controls, telematics, climate control, etc. Aftermarket offerings are a great way to capitalise on a ready market while entering a new landscape.

Collaborations and tie-ups: -

Collaborating and co-creating new business models and consumer offerings for emerging ecosystems like EV will enable the MSMEs to tap an underutilised manufacturing base. It is worth mentioning that MSMEs need to exigently form such partnerships.

Read our blog to know in details the challenges faced and solutions!,News,3 mins,the-challenges-faced-by-procurement-managers-and-their-solutions,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Steel prices in India have been on the rise over the last few weeks, driven by a rise in global prices and global sanctions. As for market participants in the steel sector, there are grounds for cautious optimism. That said, fingers are crossed in anticipation of moves by procurement managers across this sector.

The task of managing expectations in the procurement function has seldom been an easy one and that’s the case across sectors. A procurement manager at a steel based MSME represents the primary contact point between steel suppliers and their business. Multiple factors, and often conflicting ones, need to be factored in before the procurement function can hope to firm up a deal.

Supply-side challenges

Identifying qualified suppliers, who can match quality with cost, is not the least of a procurement manager’s challenges. An MSME can ill-afford a major supply chain disruption, so it takes a reliable supplier to maintain business as usual. Procurement processes must also keep a close watch on supplier performance and make sure suppliers meet the company’s established procurement policies.

Fewer vendors the better

Procurement teams make great efforts to ensure their companies benefit from volume discounts. To this end, prudent buyers prefer to buy steel in large quantities from a small pool of efficient vendors. This also means reduced shipping and logistics costs and trouble-free vendor management, apart from better supplier quality. This is where

JSW One MSME

plays a big role, preventing any stop-gaps to make procurement a more seamless task for online steel buyers through our well executed, user-friendly online platform for the

.

Tough pricing decisions

Procurement departments are responsible for negotiating with suppliers and deciding prices that are fair for all supply chain participants. In the prevailing steel market scenario, an upward adjustment in the steel price is anticipated. This will set the procurement process in motion and will likely form the baseline for specialists to negotiate favorable terms. From a procurement standpoint, pricing decision is a key consideration, but procurement decisions must balance price points with the other critical chip in this bargain, i.e., quality.

Need for just-in-time inventory

Procurement experts in MSMEs need to make sure their inventories are nearly exhausted before they can place fresh orders. Many buyers for steel products have modest stock at hand, and when it comes to replenishing their steel stock, procurement managers may choose to wait a little longer until they are done with the current inventory and consider only the most flexible of steel suppliers.

Complicated compliance mandates

Procurement managers also carry the responsibility of ensuring all of their buying decisions are in accordance with the company’s policies on anti-bribery, environmental compliance, etc. It is nearly impossible to tackle this work using manual means or legacy technologies. The best way is the automated supplier exchange with dependable steel suppliers.

A one-stop supplier exchange – it’s about time

A web-based system, capable of automating every single activity from supplier evaluation, order placement, tracking, payment, and procurement compliance management is the need of the hour. It establishes a simpler working method and straightens out difficult transactions. In the process, it serves a consistent, flexible, and trusted solution, answering the raw material needs of online steel buyers, and most of all, MSMEs. This exchange works across categories – like slitting, cut-to-length, and baby coils in the steel industry. 

With a web-enabled supplier exchange, procurement specialists can manage myriad transactions in one place. It significantly shrinks timelines and there is far more visibility to be gained into the vendor performance/landscape. As for vendors, this supplier exchange is arguably their best in terms of access and pricing, and there is equal opportunity for all. 

An automated procurement system increases transparency, trust, and ease-of-business, so nothing gets in the way of an MSME’s vision.

7CnEx2Ozx1Jm3QqQ68eBU9,How to select the right steel for your project?,6 Tips to Choose the Right Steel Grade | JSW One MSME,"Discover tips for selecting the appropriate steel grade for your project, including considerations for carbon content, operating environment, strength, machinability, and more!",Business,3 Mins,how-to-select-the-right-steel-for-your-project,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Steel is a prevalent metal used in various industries due to its exceptional strength, durability, and adaptability for different projects. Knowing about the multiple

types of steel

available before procuring it for any project is crucial, as it comes in wide varieties with varying grades and properties. The selection of steel grade can be challenging, but it is vital to consider the project's requirements. The top steel companies in India can offer guidance and assistance with selecting the right grade. This article provides a guide to help you choose the appropriate steel grade for your project. Keep reading to learn more.

Tips to select the right steel grade for your project:

1. Carbon Content

To attain specific properties in steel, it is important to choose a grade of steel with an appropriate amount of carbon. Steels with lower carbon content are easier to machine and form, and can be welded, while those with higher carbon content increase tensile strength and abrasion resistance, but decrease toughness and may lead to higher manufacturing costs due to reduced machinability, higher tempering temperatures, and increased risk of quench cracking. Although other alloying elements also contribute to strength and hardness, their effect is less significant than that of carbon and varies depending on the specific element used.

2. Operating Environment

The operating environment is of utmost importance when selecting the appropriate steel grade. The environment in which the steel will operate significantly impacts its performance quality. Physical factors such as frequency, pH levels, and temperature dictate the steel's operating conditions. For instance, in industrial warehouses where large machines are used, high heat is often generated, which can affect the steel's functionality over time. Similarly, MS chequered plates can be affected by the high heat waves emitted by furnaces or other instruments. Hence, choosing the right steel grade depending on the operating environment is essential.

3. Strength

When selecting steel, you should consider the material's tensile strength, which is its ability to withstand tension or stress. To determine the steel's tensile strength, place a sample of the steel into a machine and gradually apply external force to the product while measuring its sustainability using an extensometer device. The tensile strength is determined by the amount of pressure the sample can handle before breaking.

4. Machinability

Machinability is one of the significant properties of steel that assists in selecting the appropriate grade. It refers to a metal's ability to be cut or shaped with a smooth finish. Steel manufacturing companies use various processes to create steel products, such as

TMT bars

, pipes, and steel plates, among others. To assess the steel's machinability, observe the time taken by the tool to cut or incise the sample steel. This property is particularly important in heavy machinery applications such as reinforced bars and corrugated roofing. Therefore, understanding the properties and performance of the steel is crucial to achieving maximum output.

5. Corrosion Resistance

Corrosion resistance is another crucial factor to consider when selecting the right steel for your project. Steel that is susceptible to corrosion can deteriorate over time, compromising the structural integrity of the project. Corrosion can occur due to environmental factors such as moisture, humidity, and exposure to chemicals.

Stainless steel

is an excellent example of steel with high corrosion resistance. It contains a minimum of 10.5% chromium, which forms a thin layer of chromium oxide on the surface of the steel, protecting it from corrosion. Therefore, it is essential to consider the steel's resistance to corrosion when selecting the appropriate grade for your project.

6. Weldability

Weldability refers to a metal's ability to form a welded joint without any defects. It is essential to consider the steel's weldability when selecting the appropriate grade for your project. Weldability depends on several factors such as chemical composition, heat input, and surface cleanliness.

Steel is one of the most widely used metals across industries due to its unmatched strength, durability, and versatility. However, choosing the right steel for a particular project can be a challenging task. Steel comes in different varieties, and each variant has different grades with varying properties. It is essential to be aware of these varieties and grades before procuring steel for a project. We hope you find this guide helpful during the selection of the right steel for your project."

Click here to read 6 tips to consider when buying steel online!,Business,3 Min,6-things-to-keep-in-mind-when-buying-steel-online,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Steel is essentially an alloy formed by combining iron at very high temperatures (above 2600°F) with up to 1.5% by weight of carbon and small amounts of manganese, silicon, phosphorus, sulphur, and oxygen. Steel is everywhere, an inescapable reality of human existence. Its remarkable ability to withstand stress, coupled with low cost, makes it easy to shape this alloy into post-modern buildings, ships, trains, railcars, and machinery. In 2021, worldwide steel production touched 1,951 million tonnes, compared to 1878 million tonnes the previous year, so the demand for steel is only moving in one direction – upward.

Steel differs in mechanical properties (hardness, malleability) and chemical composition (the amount of carbon and various other alloys). Broadly, they fall into four categories - carbon steel, tool steel, alloy steel, and stainless steel.
 
Carbon steel – with up to 2% carbon, it accounts for 90% of overall steel output. Low to high varieties of this steel find application in machining, welding, petrochemicals, shipbuilding, and construction.

Tool steel – is a carbon-and-steel alloy that is not just tough but also highly corrosion-resistant due to the high ratio of vanadium and niobium.  Besides, the presence of cobalt and nickel help tool steels retain their shape and perform optimally even at high temperatures.

Alloy steel – has one or more alloying elements (aluminum, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, or silicon) added to enhance corrosion resistance.

Stainless steel – is an alloy steel usually containing 10.5%-30% chromium. With remarkably high corrosion and heat resistance, there is demand for

stainless steel

from industries as diverse as construction, the power sector, oil and gas, as well as cutlery and kitchenware.

There are over 3,000 different grades of steel for various applications, according to the World Steel Association whose members are responsible for nearly 85% of global steel output.

In a way, MSME buyers of steel are spoilt for choice. It might be difficult to make a buying decision, especially when it comes to

online steel shopping

. So, here are six things steel buyers, especially MSMEs, need to keep in mind when looking for the

best steel online

:

1. Different steel grades, different strokes

Different grades and

types of steel

often serve entirely different purposes. For construction in earthquake zones 3, 4, or 5 settle for nothing less than the best steel materials like

500D TMT bars

built using ladle refining furnace (LRF) technology. LRF expels sulphur, phosphorus, and harmful gases, and this means better toughness and added strength.

Structures coming up in coastal areas commonly use austenitic, a highly corrosion-resistant

grade of stainless steel

. Foundations, columns, and slabs might require different types of steel. When in doubt, refer to the architectural drawing of the structure. If things are still confusing, get the architect to provide details.

2. Uniform size and roundness

Thermo-mechanically treated

(TMT) iron rods

are the default standards for large load-bearing structures and these guard against flaking and cracking. TMT steels such as Fe550D, Fe600, Fe640, CRS500D, CRS550D, CRS600 are noted for their high strength, ductility, corrosion-resistance, and durability.

TMT bars

derive their uniform weight, size and roundness from automated rolling technology in the steel mills. This extreme uniformity of the rods enables their weight to be spread evenly across a structure and prevent deformations, such as warping, bending, and twisting.

3. Ribbing pattern

The ribbing pattern (anchorage) that runs along the periphery of a

TMT rod

contributes significantly to structural integrity by bonding securely with the concrete, leaving no gaps, thus reducing the chances of cracks. Properties underpinned by such high-strength construction materials require repairs less often and help save maintenance costs.

4. Rigidity and extensibility

A TMT bar, such as

Fe500D

,  has a soft ferrite pearlite core and a harsh martensite exterior. This incredible mix of rigidity and extensibility helps Fe 500D TMT steels adjust to the tensile forces acting on it in the event of, say, an earthquake!

5. Quality certifications

There is no compromise when it comes to qualifying a build environment. Choose high quality construction materials with BIS and ISO certifications as these are guarantors of quality, safety, and reliability. In case of reinforced steel bars (“rebars”) used to strengthen concrete structures, check for international standards such as IS 1786, IS 432 (MS), ASTM A706, BS 449, ASTM A615, and JIS G3112.

6. The make

No matter the channel – online or in-store, buy steel from trusted steel manufacturers with state-of-the-art manufacturing processes (specially designed water-cooling chambers for sudden and intense cooling of red-hot TMT rods) and advanced quality assurance labs. Doing business with a trusted steel solutions provider saves a lot of worry, puts the mind at ease, and ensures the best steel prices.

7Lzl1eQgUCODb7gVF3DQQG,The role of steel in sustainable construction and green building design,Role of Structural Steel for Sustainable Construction | JSW One MSME Blog,"Learn how utilising high-grade structural steel in composite construction maximises the benefits of both materials, reduces pollution, and gives architects more design freedom!",Business,3 Mins,the-role-of-steel-in-sustainable-construction-and-green-building-design,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Over the past decade, the infrastructure industry has undergone significant changes thanks to the emergence of new technologies such as composite buildings. These structures incorporate steel frameworks encased in concrete and flooring solutions like Speedfloor, pre-cast slabs, and hollow core slabs. These buildings are considered eco-friendly or green due to several factors that help reduce pollution and conserve natural resources.

To be considered a sustainable construction, a green building must meet environmental standards throughout its entire life cycle, including its design, construction, and use. Green building design aims to balance the built and natural environments, utilising natural materials and low-energy, renewable resources.

Green building is not a specific construction method but a combination of techniques, materials, and integrated technologies to improve environmental performance.

Steel

is arguably the most sustainable of the major structural materials, offering numerous benefits realised whenever steel is used.

1. Weight - Steel's lightweight characteristic makes it easy to transport over land and lift with a crane, reducing the fuel consumption required to transport it to the construction site. This also simplifies dismantling and relocating buildings, as the low weight facilitates moving and rebuilding structures.

As a result, steel is a highly desirable building material for structures with extra land available for expansion due to its added mobility and versatility.

2. Sustainability - As the demand for eco-friendly buildings grows, steel is expected to become a more attractive material for construction projects. This is due to its recyclability, as it can be easily repurposed rather than permanently disposed of.

For example, old buildings or temporary supports made from steel can be recycled and used in new projects as needed. Recovered undamaged steel components can be reused in other projects, eliminating the need to melt down and recast the alloy to create a new part. In cases where a building is being demolished and rebuilt, existing steel parts can be stripped out and repurposed to save costs. These parts can be stored for future projects or sold to another company as components or raw alloy if sold back to a steel fabrication company.

3. Strength - The high strength-to-weight ratio of steel means that less material is required for a single support or beam, resulting in lower material costs and improved sustainability. Steel is also highly resistant to physical impacts and forces, providing a high level of safety for building occupants without deteriorating or needing to be replaced afterward.

This strength can be maintained through the structure's design, rather than the amount of steel used. Additionally, alloy steel's natural fire and rust resistance makes it a suitable choice for exterior structures such as fire escapes or balcony supports. It could also be considered for use as external walls to contain insulating materials.

4. Price – Modern building regulations are highly prescriptive when it comes to construction efficiency, often resulting in reduced maintenance and material costs in the long term. While concrete is more price stable compared to steel, the costs of repairing and reinforcing a concrete beam or pillar usually make steel more cost-effective over the entire lifespan of a building. Steel is a fully recyclable material that maintains its inherent properties. Therefore, a significant amount of recovered steel can significantly reduce the cost of constructing a new structure.

Composite construction

Composite construction, which involves using steel structures encased in concrete, results in less concrete than conventional RCC (reinforced cement concrete) construction. This reduction in concrete usage reduces dust and air pollution, common byproducts of traditional RCC construction practices.

Moreover, composite construction's lower concrete consumption reduces the use of aggregates and sand. This is significant, as the depletion of natural stone quarries and river beds is a major environmental concern. Additionally, composite construction requires less water, a scarce resource and a significant environmental concern.

Composite construction also involves less material movement, which results in less traffic and further helps to reduce air pollution. Additionally, it addresses current environmental concerns such as sustainable development and environmental preservation and has demonstrated aesthetic and technical superiority over its conventional RCC counterparts.

Composite construction leverages the strengths of both concrete and steel. Steel provides the necessary strength and agility, while concrete can be molded into the desired shape to create a highly efficient and lightweight, visually appealing structure. Overall, composite construction maximises the benefits of all materials and creates superior structures in form and function.

Utilising high-quality steel, such as

E550

and

E450

, in composite construction offers numerous benefits, such as allowing for smaller column sizes, resulting in increased carpet area, shallower beams leading to higher clear floor-to-floor heights, reducing weight on the foundation, and reducing weight overall, which in turn leads to lower seismic forces. This gives architects more freedom to experiment with building designs without compromising its integrity.

Incorporating high-grade

structural steel

in composite construction can significantly decrease the material needed per square foot. Using composite columns, decking, and beams makes it possible to construct tall buildings efficiently. Construction activities can be carried out simultaneously in a vertical spread with several trades working concurrently.For example, one group may erect steel beams and columns for the top storeys while another is fixing metal decking for the floors below. As we move down the building, other groups may be tying reinforcing bars in cages, fixing formwork, pouring concrete into column molds, and concreting floors. Additionally, the weight of composite structures using high-grade steel is lower than traditional RCC structures, resulting in more cost-effective foundations.

In conclusion, steel plays a significant role in sustainable construction and green building design. Its lightweight, strength, and recyclability make it an attractive proposition for eco-friendly buildings. Composite construction, which combines steel and concrete, further maximises the benefits of both materials and reduces pollution and resource depletion. Utilising high-grade structural steel in composite construction leads to more efficient construction, decreased material usage, and cost-effective foundations. As the demand for eco-friendly buildings grows, steel is expected to become an increasingly attractive and sustainable choice for construction projects."

The industry's sole strategy for survival is to reduce production costs. Hence, understanding the factors that drive

TMT steel pricing

is crucial. In this article, we will understand all essential components of the

TMT steel bars

pricing and the variables that affect the price.

Keep reading to find out more.

1. Demand and Supply

- Demand for a product is an essential prerequisite for any industry. If there is no market need for the product, no one would want to produce it, and as a result, there won't be any supply. India, a developing nation, has a thriving infrastructure sector. As a result, our country has a huge market for premium TMT bars. The rationale is simple: Prices will rise in direct proportion to market demand. They will also grow in case the supply is constrained. On the other side, prices will decrease when supply increases and demand declines in the market. Therefore, the steel factory prices for TMT steel depend on the supply and demand for steel.

2. Cost of raw materials

- Steel manufacturers use various direct and indirect materials to produce

TMT steel bars

. Two of the essential raw materials for the production of TMT steel are iron ore and scrap metal. Changes in their cost prices directly affect the output cost or the price of the TMT steel bars. Other factors include the availability of natural resources and industry changes. TMT steel prices are directly influenced by costs associated with labour and steel production operations and material costs. The cost of operating the steel mill will increase, for instance, if energy (electricity) prices increase. As a result, the market price of TMT bars will increase. Typically, blast furnace iron billets are used to make primary TMT bars. In the production of secondary varieties of TMT bars, recycled or scrap steel is used in an electric arc furnace. TMT bars made of primary steel will cost higher than those made of secondary steel.

3. Transportation cost -

When establishing the pricing of TMT steel bars, other crucial variables that must be considered include the mode of transport used to ship the steel bars from the steel factory to the destination and the cost associated with it. For any steel manufacturer, choosing a freight option with a longer transit time can have a significant influence and significantly reduce expenses. Steel prices are significantly influenced by local and international shipping expenses.

4. Industry trends

- The prevailing trends in the steel industry significantly influence TMT steel pricing. The price at which you

buy steel

can change due to shifting dynamics in the industry or even the related industries. For instance, if the automobile industry, a significant consumer of steel, is flourishing and doing well, then the majority of the steel production will be directed to that industry, lowering the steel supply for construction. The cost of TMT steel bars will consequently increase.

5. Time of the year -

A significant aspect in determining the price at which you will purchase TMT steel bars is the time of year you wish to purchase them. Steel is no different from other commodities because its prices keep changing throughout the year. The weather, seasons, holidays, etc., influence the production and demand for steel. For instance, steel production decreases during harsh winters, and steel bar prices are consequently affected (increased) as a result.

Read our blog to know the different types of surface finishes on stainless steel and their applications!,Product,3 Mins,stainless-steel-surface-finishes-and-their-applications,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"The surface finish of steel affects much more than just its aesthetic. The performance and reliability of

stainless steel

is also affected by its surface finish. Apart from the performance and reliability, the surface finish affects corrosion resistance and attributes like electrical properties. The finish also influences weldability and manufacturing processes and contributes to different cost-related concerns.

Therefore, choosing the appropriate surface finish of stainless steel is essential.

What is stainless steel surface finish?

Surface finish refers to the appearance of stainless steel, which is created through different manufacturing techniques like polishing, rolling, and blasting. These finishes can range from dull to bright and have unique textures for specialised applications.

Several factors can affect surface finish, including the thickness of the material, the manufacturing process used, the quality of the rolls, and the level of cleanliness during production.

Types of surface finishes on Stainless steel

Stainless steel surface finishes are typically labelled with standard industry codes based on the processing route rather than the visual appearance. Below are some common types of Stainless steel surface finishes-

1. Mill Finish

These finishes represent the initial supply condition for all stainless steel products, whether produced through hot or cold rolling. They are utilised for various applications and serve as a starting point for additional finishing procedures, including mechanical polishing. To enhance corrosion resistance, most of these finishes undergo an acid cleaning process (known as pickling) to remove any scale that develops during hot rolling and annealing.

There are 3 different types of Mill finishes –

No 1 Finish - To create a No. 1 Finish, the steel is hot rolled and then subjected to annealing and pickling in acid, which results in a dull finish. This finish is typically used in applications where a smooth decorative finish is not important, such as in elevated temperature applications.

No 2 Finish – A No. 2D Finish is produced through cold rolling, followed by annealing and pickling in acid. The finish is non-reflective, dull, and smooth, making it ideal for deep drawing applications. This finish can be found in various products, such as auto exhaust components, chemical equipment, and hardware.

No 2B Finish -  A No. 2B Finish is achieved through cold rolling, annealing, and pickling, followed by a light temper pass using polished rolls. This finish is smooth, relatively reflective, and bright, making it a general-purpose cold-rolled finish commonly used in producing cookware, small tanks, and pharmaceutical equipment.

2.

Bright Annealed Finish

The Bright Annealed Finish is achieved by cold rolling the stainless steel and annealing in a controlled environment to prevent scale formation. Unlike other finishes, this type does not require acid pickling as a thin oxide film is formed during annealing, eliminating the need for pickling. The Bright Annealed Finish is commonly used for trim appliances, surgical instruments, and cookware applications.

3.

Mechanically Polished finishes

Mechanically polished finishes are achieved by grinding or polishing the surface with progressively finer abrasives. These finishes are typically designated as ""No. 3,"" ""No. 4,"" ""No. 6,"" and ""No. 7"" finishes, with a higher number indicating a finer polishing grit.

No. 3 and No. 4 finishes have a dull appearance and are commonly used for architectural applications such as handrails, elevator doors, and storefronts.

No. 6 and No. 7 finishes have a brighter, mirror-like appearance and are used for decorative applications such as automotive trim and decorative hardware.

Mechanically polished finishes offer numerous benefits, including improved corrosion resistance, aesthetics, and enhanced cleanability. However, they can also be more expensive than other finishes and may require additional processing steps to achieve the desired level of polish.

To achieve a mechanically polished finish, the

stainless steel

is first passed through a series of abrasive belts or wheels, with progressively finer abrasives used at each step. After the final polishing step, the surface may be treated with a passivation solution to enhance its corrosion resistance.

4.

Custom finishes

Custom finishes are available for applications which require specific surface characteristics beyond the standard finishes. These finishes can be achieved through various processes, such as electro-polishing, and bead blasting.

Electro-polishing is an electrochemical process that removes a thin layer of the surface material to create a smooth, shiny finish. This process is commonly used for medical and pharmaceutical equipment because it removes surface contaminants and improves corrosion resistance.

Bead blasting, also known as sandblasting, involves shooting small beads or particles at the material's surface to create a matte finish with a uniform texture. This finish is often used when a non-reflective surface is desired, such as outdoor signage or machine parts.

To create a unique texture or pattern, custom finishes can also be achieved by combining different surface treatments, such as brushing and chemical etching. The possibilities for custom finishes are virtually endless, making it possible to achieve the desired surface characteristics for any application.

The surface finishing of stainless steel is highly relevant in its applications as it impacts several important factors beyond just aesthetics. The choice of surface finish can impact corrosion resistance, electrical properties, weldability, and manufacturing operations. It can also contribute to various cost concerns.

In certain applications, such as superconductor components or flexible metal hoses, the surface finish of stainless steel must be specific for the end-use product to function as designed. The wrong finish could cause the product to fail or not meet the required specifications.

Additionally, the surface finish can impact the cleanability and hygiene of

stainless steel

products used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The smoother the surface finish, the easier it is to clean and maintain the hygiene of the equipment.

Selecting the appropriate surface finish for a stainless steel application is critical to ensuring the product's performance, reliability, and functionality."
4dJMbhkTdEMjU18FAcLD79,The effect of strain rate and temperature on the mechanical behaviour of mild steel,How Does Strain Rate Impact Mild Steel | JSW One MSME Blog,Mild steel is greatly impacted by strain rate and temperature in various ways. Read our blog to know more about strain rate and mild steel!,N/A,N/A,the-effect-of-strain-rate-and-temperature-on-the-mechanical-behaviour-of,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Steel is a widely used material in various applications, such as bridges, buildings, ships, and automotive. These applications are subjected to different types of loads, so it is crucial to understand the mechanical properties of steel under various loading conditions.

Understanding how strain rate and temperature affect the mechanical properties of steel is essential for designing and manufacturing high-quality products that can withstand various loading conditions.

This blog post will discuss how steel's strain rate and temperature impact its mechanical properties.

What is Strain Rate? How does it affect the mechanical properties of steel?

Stain rate is the rate at which steel deforms per unit time, usually expressed in units per second (s^-1). The strain rate is an important parameter affecting steel's mechanical properties. When steel is subjected to an external force or load, it deforms or changes shape. The extent of this deformation depends on the magnitude and duration of the applied load and the properties of the steel itself.

For example, the strain rate experienced by steel during a slow bending process would be very low, while the strain rate during an explosive impact would be very high. The strain rate of steel can be affected by several factors, such as the speed of the applied load, temperature, and the type of loading. It can also vary depending on the specific type of steel, as different steel alloys can have different strain rate sensitivities.

Steel is ductile at low strain rates, it can withstand more stress without breaking, and can deform easily without breaking.

However, at high strain rates, steel loses its ductility and becomes brittle, which means it can fracture more easily without deforming. This impacts steel’s ability to absorb energy and increase its propensity to to fail catastrophically at high temperatures.

In general applications, the strain rate of steel is often an important consideration, particularly in areas such as impact testing, crashworthiness, and high-speed machining. Knowing the strain rate of steel materials can help engineers better understand and predict its behaviour under different loading conditions, which can be useful in optimizing designs and improving safety.

The Effect of Temperature on Steel's Mechanical Properties

The temperature also has a significant impact on the mechanical properties of steel. Steel becomes stronger but more brittle at low temperatures due to decreased ductility.

On the other hand, steels ductility increases at high temperatures and can withstand additional stresses before breaking. However, at very high temperatures, steel can become soft and weak, leading to excessive deformation or failure.

Examples of strain rate and temperature affecting some of the common applications of steel:-

1.

Automotive Industry:

In the automotive industry, mild steel is widely used to manufacture structural components, such as car frames and chassis. High strain rate steel is typically used for safety-critical such as the car's safety cage, which is designed to absorb energy in the event of a crash. It can also help reduce the weight of the vehicle without sacrificing safety. On the other hand, lower strain rate steel is typically used for non-critical parts where fatigue resistance is more critical, such as the car's chassis, suspension system, and other non-critical parts.

Steel is also subject to high temperatures in applications such as exhaust systems and engine components. High temperatures can cause steel to undergo thermal expansion, leading to dimensional changes and stress concentrations, potentially resulting in premature failure. Therefore, steel components used in high-temperature applications must be designed with proper allowances for thermal expansion and made of materials that can withstand the expected temperature range.

2.

Construction Industry:

In the construction industry, the choice of strain rate of steel depends on the specific application and the desired mechanical properties. High-strain rate steel is often preferred for safety-critical parts of a structure, and where the steel components are subjected to dynamic loads such as wind and seismic forces such as the support beams in a bridge. In contrast, lower strain rate steel is more suitable for parts that are subjected to static loads, such as the building's frame.

At high temperatures, steel can experience a loss of strength and ductility due to thermal softening, which can compromise the structure's integrity. On the other hand, steel structures exposed to low temperatures can experience reduced toughness and increased brittleness, making them susceptible to brittle fracture.

3. Manufacturing Industry:

In the manufacturing industry, mild steel is used to produce a wide range of products, such as pipes, fittings, and machinery components. The strain rate and temperature can affect the machinability and weldability of mild steel in these applications. For example,

mild steel

can exhibit improved machinability at low strain rates, making it easier to manufacture components with complex shapes. At high temperatures, however, mild steel can exhibit increased susceptibility to cracking during welding, reducing the quality of these components.

Understanding how strain rate and temperature affect the mechanical properties of steel is crucial for designing and manufacturing high-quality products that can withstand various loading conditions. The strain rate and temperature can significantly impact the ductility, strength, toughness, and load-carrying capacity of steel, which are essential for its various applications, including construction, automotive, and manufacturing industries.

Therefore, engineers and designers should consider the effect of strain rate and temperature on steel's mechanical properties while selecting the appropriate material and designing structures or components to ensure their reliability, durability, and safety."
1EbMGA4sDe0inuYlgOrtz3,Construction versus Natural Disasters – How do TMT Bars protect?,TMT Bars: Protection from Natural Disasters | JSW One MSME Blog,TMT Bars immensely help in increasing the structural integrity of any construction. Agreed? Read on the JSW One MSME Blog to know more about how TMT Bars protect from natural disasters!,Product,3 Mins,construction-versus-natural-disasters-how-do-tmt-bars-protect,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"One of the usual concerns when working on a construction project is the quality of the material and construction. Urban construction today boasts lucrative features like multi-faceted designs suited to the regime and needs of its users, spectacular architecture and incredible height. So many of these construction projects are located in seismic zones or zones which are prone to natural disasters. While it is not possible to avert these calamities, it is possible to mitigate the loss of life and property in case of a natural disaster.

TMT bars

are a game changer when it comes to increasing the structural integrity of any construction. Read on to discover how TMT bars provide stability and strength to urban structures and skyscrapers to bear nature's brunt.

TMT bars or Thermo mechanically treated bars go through a thermo-mechanical process to make alternatives of different grade steels with broad applications. This process in TMT bars applies ineffectiveness by developing a heat slant between the cooler surface and the new inner core. As a result, TMT bars have a more rigid outer surface with higher durability and a softer inner core for better tensile strength. This process ensures higher corrosion resistance in the rods, superior weldability and higher ductility. These TMT bars can be readily welded to produce the best results, allowing the architects to develop different structures.

How are TMT Bars instrumental in protecting constructions against Natural Disasters?

1.

Fire: -

Fire is the most destructive natural disaster which disturbs the structure, stability and durability of a building. No wonder the fire safety of any building is the topmost priority for all engineers and builders. TMT bars have a higher thermal capacity and can withstand a temperature up to 600 degrees Celsius. High fire resistance makes

TMT rods

perfect for providing safety from fire.

2.

Rain:

Floods can cause significant corrosion to a structure due to prolonged water exposure. TMT bars protect the buildings in humid environments like coastal areas, underground areas and marine constructions. The unique manufacturing process of TMT bars offers them high resistance to corrosion and high durability against flood water forces. TMT bars are also ideal for construction in water-exposed areas since they do not need further cold twisting to make them corrosion-resistant.

3.

Earthquakes:

- The pearlite core of the TMT bars gives them high ductility and fatigue confrontation to tolerate dynamic loading and helps a structure absorb the vibration and shock waves caused by earthquakes, minimising damage. Hence it makes sense to use

TMT steel rods

that are made for use in earthquake-prone zones.

4. Storms:

Heavy winds like hurricanes, cyclones, and tornadoes can cause immense damage to buildings and threaten life and property in and around. Using TMT bars can help you fight off the damages because of their strength, fatigue resistance and bendability.

Whether building an individual house or a multimillion-dollar skyscraper, TMT bars play a vital role. They are used in beams, columns, slabs, pillars and other structures. TMT bars are used to provide strength to the building.

However, there are various types of TMT bars available in the market. It would help if you learned about them to be able to decide which one suits your project the most.

Fe 415 –

This is the lowest grade of TMT bars used for reinforcing small-scale construction projects like residential homes and apartments. Because of their uniform elongation property, they are also used in earthquake-prone areas.

Fe 500 –

The most prominent of all TMT bars, Fe 500 are the standard bars widely used in construction projects of varied scales ranging from residential to commercial to multi-storied buildings. These bars' tensile strength and ductility are higher than Fe 415, providing better stability and load resistance.

Fe 550 –

These bars are used in constructing larger infrastructure projects like bridges, industrial plants etc.

Fe 600 –

These TMT bars are used where the construction demands high load bearing, durability and corrosion resistance, like highways, metros and power plants.

One of the essential points to ensure while buying TMT bars is quality. Buy from brands whose bars are certified by the International Standards Organisation (ISO), which is a marker of top quality. To ensure that you buy genuine TMT bars, check for the manufacturer's identification mark on the bars. The carbon content of the bars should be lower than 0.25 to be corrosion-resistant. Higher carbon content decreases the life of the building.

4ty4CxoeBGmCWm1DAMoeRA,How to select the right welding rod,N/A,N/A,Product,3 Mins,how-to-select-the-right-welding-rod,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Since there isn't a universal welding rod that can be used for welding in all situations, choosing the proper welding rod can be a real hassle. We have perhaps spared you at least a few headaches by developing an extensive guide to choosing

welding rods

. How can you pick the correct welding rod?

To choose the right

welding rod

, you will need to consider –

Base metal(s) you will be welding -

When choosing a rod, base metal or parent metal is one of the most crucial considerations. The mechanical characteristics of the rod and the base metal should be similar or as close as is practical, notably the tensile strength.

Particularly in terms of the carbon content, the chemical makeup of the electrode and the base metal should be the same.

Welding Position -

The welding position is the second consideration. Each rod has a specific welding position for which it is intended. As a result, you must select a rod that is appropriate for your job. The electrode name itself contains the welding position information; for example, the E7018 electrode's second-to-last digit, 1, indicates the position in which the electrode can be utilised. The four most commonly used welding rods are all position welding rods. There are 4 major welding positions – flat, overhead, vertical and horizontal.

Power Supply -

Some rods can be used with an alternating current (AC) power source, while others can be used with a direct current (DC) power source. Some rods also function well with both AC and DC. So, you can select the electrode based on the welding machine's power output. For instance, you won't be able to use electrodes designed for usage with AC if the machine can only provide AC output. However, you have a wider selection of electrodes to pick from if the welding equipment can produce both AC and DC output.

Welding quality -

The required quality and the weld finishing is also important factor to be considered before selecting a rod. A welding rod can be chosen depending on the final finishing requirement.

Welding Numbers -

You will see a four- or five-digit number followed by a letter when looking for welding electrodes, like:- E6013 - Arc welding electrode"" is what ""E"" stands for. The welding rod's tensile strength is indicated by the first two digits ""60,"" which is 60,000 psi (pounds per square inch). The next-to-last digit designates the welding position; a ""1"" denotes a welding rod with all positions. The final digit denotes the type of coating; for example, a ""3"" is coated with high titania potassium.

Welding Cost -

Last but not least, you should take your project's requirements into account when determining the electrode's cost. For a project with a small budget, we cannot select an expensive electrode. A low hydrogen electrode with increased ductility, such as E7018, might be considered to meet the quality criteria for essential applications where quality must be given the highest care.

Once you have checked these parameters also consider the below two points:-

Welding with AC Machine

–An electrical circuit with a negative and positive pole is produced when you switch on your welding device. A strong, constant weld can be formed by ensuring appropriate polarity, as opposed to a weak weld that exhibits inconsistent behavior and significant spatter. Alternating current (AC) welding machines work with electricity that alternates between negative and positive polarities on a regular basis, mimicking the motion of a sine wave. Because they are inexpensive, AC welding machines are marketed toward beginners. Depending on the situation and the skill level of the machine operator, there are times when using AC welding equipment makes more sense.

Welding with DC Machine -

The current used by Direct Current (DC) welding machines has the same polarity throughout the whole procedure. When welding with DC current, the arc is more steady and the weld bead has less spatter. The result is significantly more streamlined. Only DC current is compatible with 6010 electrodes. Since electrodes are frequently sold in this way, you can frequently discover electrodes compatible with DC current by simply searching for ""DC welding rods"" online. Pay close attention to the welding rod's coating. Only DCEP can be utilised with an electrode constructed of cellulose sodium (Direct current, positive polarity)

In addition, ensure sure your base metal is completely free of dust, rust, grease, and other impurities before starting your welding technique. This is a crucial step in achieving the ideal intended weld. We really hope that this article has improved your understanding of the welding electrode choosing procedure.

Read our blog to know the factors that affect the corrosion resistance of stainless steel!,Business,3 Mins,the-corrosion-resistance-of-stainless-steel-how-it-works-and-how-to-optimise,Read Now,['Yes'],N/A,"Stainless steel alloy is made up of iron, chromium, and other elements such as nickel, molybdenum, and manganese. The addition of chromium to the alloy is what gives stainless steel its corrosion-resistant properties.

This property makes it suitable for various industrial applications, including construction, transportation, food processing, and medical equipment.

In this article, we will explore how the corrosion resistance of

stainless steel

works and how it can be optimised to improve its performance.

How Does Corrosion Resistance Work in Stainless Steel?

Corrosion is a process that occurs when a metal is exposed to an environment that contains oxygen and moisture. This can lead to the formation of a thin layer of metal oxide on the surface of the metal, which can cause the metal to degrade over time. However,

stainless steel

can resist corrosion due to chromium in the alloy.

When chromium is exposed to oxygen in the atmosphere, it forms a thin, transparent layer of chromium oxide on the surface of the

stainless steel

. This layer is only a few atoms thick but is highly durable and acts as a protective barrier against further oxidation. The chromium oxide layer is self-repairing, which means that if it is damaged, it can quickly reform to protect the underlying metal.

The presence of other elements in the alloy, such as nickel, molybdenum, and manganese, can also contribute to the corrosion resistance of stainless steel. These elements can help improve the alloy's strength and durability and enhance its resistance to pitting, crevice corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking.

Factors that can affect the corrosion resistance of stainless steel

While stainless steel is highly resistant to corrosion, several factors can affect its performance in certain conditions. Some of these factors include:

Chloride exposure:

Chloride ions found in saltwater can be particularly damaging to stainless steel. When exposed to chlorides, stainless steel can suffer from pitting corrosion, which is characterised by small, localised holes in the surface of the metal.

Temperature:

The corrosion resistance of stainless steel can be affected by temperature. The passive layer can break down more quickly at high temperatures, leaving the metal vulnerable to corrosion.

Surface finish:

The surface finish of stainless steel can also affect its corrosion resistance. Rough, pitted, or contaminated surfaces can be more prone to corrosion than smooth, clean surfaces.

Chemical exposure:

Stainless steel can be damaged by certain chemicals, such as acids or alkalis. The specific type of stainless steel used in a particular application should be chosen based on its compatibility with the chemicals it will be exposed to.

How to Optimise Corrosion Resistance in Stainless Steel?

While stainless steel is already highly resistant to corrosion, several steps can be taken to optimise its performance in different environments. These steps include:

There are several steps that can be taken to optimise the corrosion resistance of stainless steel in different applications. Some of these include:

1.

Choosing the Right Grade of Stainless Steel-

Stainless steel is available in a wide range of grades, each of which is designed for specific applications. The grade of stainless steel that is used will depend on factors such as the type of environment it will be exposed to, the level of corrosion resistance required, and the strength and durability needed for the application.

For example, if the stainless steel will be used in a marine environment, a grade such as 316 stainless steel may be the best choice. This grade contains molybdenum, enhancing its corrosion resistance in saltwater environments. In contrast, if the stainless steel will be used in a high-temperature environment, a grade such as 310 stainless steel may be more suitable due to its high-temperature resistance.

2.

Proper Cleaning and Maintenance -

Even though stainless steel is highly resistant to corrosion, it is still essential to clean and maintain it properly to ensure optimal performance. Over time, dirt, grime, and other contaminants can build up on the stainless steel's surface, compromising its corrosion resistance. Therefore, it is essential to clean stainless steel surfaces using mild detergent and water regularly.

In addition, any scratches or damage to the surface of the stainless steel should be repaired as soon as possible. This will help prevent corrosion in these areas and ensure the longevity of the stainless steel.

3.

Proper Fabrication and Finishing -

The way stainless steel is fabricated and finished can also impact its corrosion resistance. For example, if the stainless steel is welded using improper techniques, it can cause the chromium oxide layer to break down, which can lead to corrosion. Therefore, it is essential to use proper welding techniques and ensure proper fabrication and finishing to the stainless steel.

4.

Maintenance -

Regular cleaning and maintenance can help to keep stainless steel surfaces in good condition and prevent corrosion. This can include using non-abrasive cleaning agents, avoiding using steel wool or other harsh abrasives, and rinsing the surface thoroughly after cleaning.

5.

Design considerations:

Proper design can also help to optimise the corrosion resistance of stainless steel in different applications. For example, providing proper drainage in a marine environment can help to prevent the buildup of saltwater on stainless steel surfaces, which can lead to corrosion. In addition, avoiding crevices or areas where water can pool can help to prevent pitting corrosion.

In conclusion, stainless steel is a highly durable material with excellent corrosion resistance. Its unique properties make it an ideal choice for various applications, from construction to biomedical engineering. However, even stainless steel can succumb to corrosion if improperly handled and maintained. These best practices can help ensure that

stainless steel products

continue to function optimally for years."
5PwKHrFyYkVl4DNwSwLtCD,The impact of impurities and alloying elements on the mechanical properties of mild steel,Effect of impurities on Mild Steel | JSW One MSME Blog ,Impurities and alloying elements impact the mechanical properties of mild steel in contradictory ways. Read our blog to understand the effects and select the most appropriate mild steel for your application.,Product,3 Mins,the-impact-of-impurities-and-alloying-elements-on-the-mechanical-properties,Read Now,N/A,['Yes'],"Mild steel

is a commonly used material in various industries and construction due to its versatility, affordability, and ease of fabrication. However, the mechanical properties of mild steel can be significantly affected by the presence of impurities and alloying elements.

Impurities like Sulphur, Phosphorus, and Oxygen can reduce mild steel's ductility, toughness, and weldability. In contrast, alloying elements such as Manganese, Chromium, Nickel, and Carbon can improve the strength, hardness, and resistance to wear and corrosion. However, adding too many of these elements can also reduce the toughness and ductility of mild steel.

Understanding the impact of impurities and alloying elements on the mechanical properties of

mild steel

is crucial for selecting the right type of mild steel for different applications. It also plays a vital role in determining the appropriate welding and fabrication methods and ensuring the finished products' safety and reliability.

This article will cover the impact of impurities and alloying elements on the mechanical properties of mild steel to understand the behaviour and performance of this material.

Effects of Impurities on Mild Steel

1.Sulphur –

Sulphur can have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of mild steel, particularly its ductility and toughness. This is because Sulphur can form brittle iron sulfide particles, which act as stress concentrators and reduce the ability of the material to withstand stress without fracturing. The presence of Sulphur can also increase the likelihood of cracking during hot working processes, such as forging and rolling.

2. Phosphorus

Phosphorus can form brittle intermetallic compounds with iron, reducing the ductility and toughness of the material. In addition, Phosphorus can also increase the strength of the steel, but at the cost of reduced ductility and toughness.

3. Oxygen

Oxygen is often present in mild steel in the form of oxides, which can reduce the strength and ductility of the material. This is because the oxides can act as stress concentrators and reduce the ability of the material to withstand stress without fracturing. The presence of Oxygen can also increase the likelihood of surface defects, such as porosity and inclusions, which can further reduce the material's mechanical properties.

Sulphur, Phosphorus, and Oxygen are impurities that can significantly impact the mechanical properties of steel. High levels of these impurities can lead to reduced steel strength, toughness, and ductility, making it less suitable for certain applications. To minimise the impact of these impurities on steel's mechanical properties, steelmakers can take the following steps:

1.

Use high-quality raw materials:

Steel makers should ensure that they use high-quality raw materials to minimise the presence of impurities in the steel. This includes using high-grade iron ore, coking coal, and other raw materials with low Sulphur, Phosphorus, and Oxygen levels.

2.

Improve the steelmaking process:

The steelmaking process can be optimised to reduce impurities in the steel. For example, steel makers can use desulphurisation and dephosphorisation techniques to remove these impurities from the molten steel. Similarly, Oxygen can be removed by using vacuum degassing techniques.

3.

Adopt strict quality control measures:

Steelmakers should implement strict quality control measures to ensure the steel meets the required specifications. This includes testing the steel for impurities and other defects affecting its mechanical properties.

4.

Use alloying elements:

Alloying elements such as Manganese, Silicon, and Aluminium can be added to the steel to counter the adverse effects of Sulphur, Phosphorus, and Oxygen. For example, manganese can combine with Sulphur to form manganese sulfide, which is a less harmful inclusion than iron sulfide.

Impact of alloying elements

Alloying elements are added to steel to improve its strength, hardness, corrosion resistance, and other mechanical properties. The most common alloying elements added to mild steel include Manganese, Silicon, Nickel, Chromium, and Molybdenum.

1. Manganese

is mild steel's most commonly used alloying element. It is added to improve the strength and toughness of the steel. Manganese also helps in the formation of austenite, a type of crystal structure that is known for its excellent ductility and toughness.

2. Silicon

is another commonly used alloying element in mild steel. Silicon helps in the deoxidation process during steel production, improving the steel quality. The addition of Silicon to mild steel significantly improves its hardness and tensile strength, making it suitable for applications that require high strength and wear resistance.

3. Nickel

is a versatile alloying element that improves the toughness and ductility of steel. It also enhances the corrosion resistance of steel, making it suitable for use in harsh environments. Nickel also helps to stabilise the austenitic structure in stainless steel, which improves its high-temperature performance.

4. Chromium

is highly resistant to corrosion and oxidation, making it an ideal material for use in environments that are exposed to high temperatures and harsh chemicals. Chromium also helps improve steel's strength and hardness, making it suitable for use in applications that require high strength and wear resistance. The addition of Chromium to steel results in the formation of a passive oxide layer on the surface, which provides protection against corrosion and improves the material's durability.

5. Molybdenum

– Adding Molybdenum to mild steel significantly improves its strength and toughness, making it suitable for applications that require high strength and toughness. Molybdenum also improves the high-temperature resistance of the steel, making it ideal for applications that require high-temperature resistance.

Both impurities and alloying elements significantly impact the mechanical properties of mild steel. Impurities such as Sulphur, Phosphorus, and Oxygen can reduce the material's ductility, toughness, and weldability. At the same time, alloying elements like Manganese, Silicon, Nickel, Chromium, and Molybdenum can improve steel's strength, hardness, and resistance to wear and corrosion.

Understanding the effects of these elements is crucial for selecting the appropriate type of mild steel for different applications and ensuring the safety and reliability of finished products. Steelmakers can reduce impurities' impact and utilise alloying elements to enhance mild steel's mechanical properties. By doing so, they can meet various industries' requirements and construction while promoting sustainability through optimised steel production processes."

It is ductile and exhibits magnetic properties at room temperature. First discovered in the 1700s, nickel is used as a catalyst to various chemical reactions and is one of the main alloying elements in stainless steel. Nickel in Stainless Steel is a widely used constituent.

Overview of nickel-containing stainless steel

Nickel-containing stainless steels have an inherent resistance to corrosion in addition to being easy to shape and weld, ductile at very low temperatures and suitable for high-temperature applications. The austenite region of steel is widened and the ferrite region is contracted by nickel, an austenite stabilizer. At high temperatures, nickel increases resistance to corrosion and oxidation. The hardness and strength of nickel are increased by reducing the grain size. Additionally, they are not magnetic, as compared to conventional steel and stainless steel without nickel. This implies that they can be transformed for diverse material applications such as the chemical industry, health industry, as well as home interior and appliances

Nickel is a critical constituent for steel making so much so that 75% of stainless steel manufacturing constitutes of grades that contain nickel. The grades with the maximum nickel component are Type 316, which has 11% nickel, and Type 304, which has 8% nickel.

Nickel provides these properties to steel by changing its crystal structure to an austenitic (face-centred cubic crystal) structure at almost all temperatures. At room temperature, conventional steel has a ferritic (cubic crystal with a body-centred structure) structure. These distinctive qualities are only given by the addition of enough nickel, usually 8–10%.

How does nickel impact the properties of stainless steel?

1.

Formability –

The austenitic structure of stainless steel provides it with excellent formability and ductility.  Particularly, Grade 304, which contains 8% nickel and 18% chromium, exhibits good ductility.  A slightly higher nickel concentration would improve the austenite's stability even further. This also makes it more suitable for deep drawing. These alloys are not prone to delayed cold cracking, unlike low-nickel, high-manganese alloys. Due to their outstanding formability, 300-series austenitic alloys are frequently employed for products like cooking pots and sinks.

2.

Weldability -

Welding is a common method of fabrication for stainless steel equipment. In general, nickel austenitic alloys, especially Grade 304 and 316 are the most often fabricated

stainless steels

in the world. They are also better for welding than other alloys. They don't tend to become brittle like ferritic alloys do because of high-temperature grain development, and the welds have great bend and impact qualities. Both thick and thin portions can be easily welded together.

3.

High temperature properties -

The austenitic alloys of stainless steel that contain nickel have much stronger high-temperature strength than other alloys, especially when it comes to their capacity to withstand creep, or the tendency to move slowly or permanently deform under mechanical forces. Additionally, these alloys are far less likely to develop destructive brittle phases when subjected to temperatures higher than 300 degrees Celsius.  During thermal cycling, nickel decreases spalling and stabilises the protective oxide covering. For applications requiring high temperatures and fire resistance, austenitic alloys are used.

4.

Corrosion resistance

- The chromium-rich oxide layer is primarily responsible for stainless steels' resistance to corrosion. However, this layer is prone to damage, especially when chlorides are present, and such damage can trigger localised corrosion such pitting and crevice corrosion. In the presence of chlorides, molybdenum and nitrogen both increase resistance to pit initiation. Although nickel does not influence this in the initial phase, but it is crucial in reducing the rate at which both crevice corrosion and pitting spread. Additionally, nickel affects how resistant stainless steel is to chloride stress-corrosion cracking, a different type of localised corrosion. However, there is minimal resistance in these circumstances at nickel concentrations of about 8%. At nickel levels, both lower and higher than this, stress corrosion-cracking resistance increases noticeably.

5.

Lustre and Finish -

All

stainless steel grades

appear similar at first glance. Comparing identically polished surface finishes side by side does reveal variations in colour and lustre, though. The 200-series grades typically appear darker and the ferritic grades cooler-looking than the nickel austenitic grades; nonetheless, appearance and aesthetic attributes will always be a matter of preference. Although customers prefer a brighter, whiter metal, the popularity of the 300-series is evidence that there are some architectural applications where a greyer colour may be desirable. Due to their innate work-hardening qualities, the 200- and 300-series stainless steels are also more scratch-resistant.

It is clear that the common nickel-containing austenitic grades are excellent all-around performers.  They are easily available, well-known, adaptable, and simple to use. Additionally, they work well and are extensively recyclable. All of this means that they frequently offer the most useable, low-risk solution."

Read on to know more!",Product,3 Min,what-to-pick-steel-copper-brass-or-bronze,Read Now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"The periodic table of chemical elements used by high school students lists nearly 95 metals, which is about 80% of that tabular display.  Some of the more commonly used metals/alloys are copper, brass, and bronze. The most popular of all metals/alloys is steel.

All of these metals and alloys come with their own ingrained strengths and utilities. Many consumers know what alloy they want, while others would have made up their minds well before calling the dealer. However, this is not the case with everyone. Understanding the need and the metals, their key attributes, and most common applications will ease the buying decision. Here’s a dipstick study of these most popular alloys and metals to know if you need to make

steel products

or something else entirely.

Steel, the No. 1 choice

Steel is an alloy formed by adding carbon to iron: it helps increase its ability to withstand stress and corrosion. Iron is a magnetic material; therefore, the alloy carries magnetic properties.

Hot and cold-rolled steel

Steel can be rolled out at high temperature (1700°F or more)  into desired dimensions, while still hot, and cooled further to room temperature for additional strength.

Hot Rolled or HR steel sheets

are less expensive than cold-rolled ones and are used wherever extreme dimensional accuracy and surface finish are not so relevant. For example, agricultural equipment and automobile parts.

Cold-rolled steel (CRS)

is HR steel that has undergone further processing at high pressure – albeit at room temperature. And since cold rolling involves more processing, this steel tends to be more expensive than the hotter product. But the tradeoff is worth the expense.

CR sheets

come with shiny and smooth surface quality, improved strength, and high corrosion resistance. This makes an ideal choice where precision is a key criterion.

Annealed steel

Cold steels suffer from tensile tensions trapped within them during the production process. So, they need to be “annealed” by heating to a certain degree (1900°F), followed by slow cooling in a controlled atmosphere.   This lowers the hardness of the alloy and relieves internal stresses while increasing its ductility and machinability. It also improves its electric conductivity.

Tempered steel

This is steel treated at around 2500°F and then rapidly cooled. Tempered steel features superior strength and hardness and is capable of carrying high loads and withstanding deformation.

Spring steel

As the name suggests, these steels are at once resilient and pliable and are capable of absorbing stress, “springing” back to their former shape. This strength is achieved through heat treatment and rolling. It is commonly used in springs, washers, antennas, saw blades, lawn mower components, coil springs, and certain landing gears.

Stainless steel

Stainless steel

displays remarkably high corrosion and heat resistance, a strength it owes to the 10.5%-30% of chromium in it. Not surprisingly, there is demand for stainless steel from industries as diverse as kitchenware to construction and energy.

Steel has become ubiquitous by virtue of its remarkable ability to withstand stress and it is wallet-friendly. However, that is no reason to discount the shaping role in our lives played by other metals/alloys like: -

Copper, Brass, Bronze

Copper has been in use since about 8000 BC.  Properties like high availability, ductility, as well as electrical/thermal conductivity make it the obvious choice in wiring and electrical components. Copper wire, with its sheen, is perfect for jewellery and décor. In alloy form, (e.g. Zirconium, Beryllium copper), it exhibits high strength, besides good-to-high electrical conductivity.

Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, and lead is also commonly added to it to make it highly machinable. This apart, brass has attractive properties like a low melting point and thermal/electrical conductivity. It can withstand regular wear and tear, pressure and damage, and is used in locks, hinges, bearings, and musical instruments. Cartridge brass alloy, with high zinc content, finds application in wood screws, rivets, fasteners, and springs.

Bronze is another copper alloy, this time with tin. By its very nature, bronze is highly ductile and corrosion resistant. Phosphor bronze, a specialised alloy, is used in fasteners, switches, relays, contacts, springs, bolts, and bearings because of its high resistance to fatigue and wear.

Each material has its inherent strengths and it’s not a one versus the other scenario. If steel is your requirement, it’s important that you buy from

Agreed? Read on to know more about black stainless steel, its applications and advantages!",Product,3 Mins,black-stainless-steel-the-new-champion-in-appliance-manufacturing,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Since its release, there has been much talk over black stainless steel. Black stainless steel appliances are emerging big on the trends.

So what is it, and why is it growing in popularity?

Simply put, black stainless steel is a coating applied over stainless steel. This coating minimises any light reflection. It is the composition of silicon, chromium, iron, nickel and carbon in addition to the protective polymer coating, which gives it a black matte finish. The dark translucent finish also has a top coat, making it less prone to fingerprints.

Compared to regular stainless steel, black stainless steel is bold and fresh. While it is not yet close to taking over

traditional stainless steel

, especially in the case of appliance manufacturing, it is undoubtedly on the upswing.

Applications of black stainless steel: -

Black stainless steel is generally used to manufacture consumer goods and appliances like refrigerators, washers and dryers, stoves and dishwashers.

Black stainless steel advantages :-

Smudge and Fingerprint resistance –

Conventional stainless steel is much more prone to smudges and fingerprints due to its metallic surface, which translates into extra work for you to keep it clean.

Its trendy –

Black stainless steel complements many colour schemes and design concepts because of its matte finish, which feels warmer than standard stainless steel.

A statement piece –

Appliances made of black stainless steel serve as statement pieces, especially in kitchens. With the concept of an open kitchen becoming the norm, statement appliances continue to grow in demand.

Scratch resistant –

Unlike

conventional stainless steel

, black stainless steel is more scratch resistant because of its solid, homogeneous surface.

Timeless –

As sophisticated and stylish as the colour black is, it is also a universal colour. Black is a prominent colour that matches nearly every other colour and warm and cold tones, making black stainless steel appliances timeless and easy to use with different colours and shades.

Disadvantages of black stainless steel –

1. Clash of different black coatings –

Stainless steel appliances generally have a clear or tinted top coat, making them traditional stainless. On the other hand, black stainless has a darker tint coating of charcoal grey colour which also gives it a more premium look. Black stainless steel finishes also negate mould growth. The colour of these appliances does not change until abrasives are used while washing or cleaning.

2. Scratches –

Black stainless steel is scratch-resistant but not scratch-proof. It is much more visible than ordinary stainless steel if it gets scratched. The coating on this steel may also peel off easily.

3. Expensive –

Black stainless steel appliances are a lot costlier than stainless steel.

Is Black stainless steel here to stay?

The white goods industry is expected to witness a CAGR of 11% till 2025, aided by the increased demand for new and innovative products and fulfilled supply.

The appliances industry in India is highly concerted, with goods like refrigerators, ACs and washing machines capturing over 75% of the market share, which presents a lucrative opportunity for appliance MSMEs. India FY 21 Exports for these categories amounted to a whopping $571 Mn. This is a positive sign for the MSMEs in this industry. Ease of entry and supportive government policies like PLI make running this business easy.

As people are coming to better appreciate and relish their living spaces, black accents and appliances are not just the rage but are also leading the way in modern houses, and for good reasons. The timeless appeal of black stainless steel holds up well and an increasing number of people are opting for this dark hue."

Read our blog to explore the contemporary uses of mild steel. Click here now!,Product,3 Mins,contemporary-uses-of-mild-steel,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Mild steel

is a type of low-carbon steel that contains a small percentage of carbon (between 0.05 - 0.25%) to enhance the properties of pure iron. Mild steel is available in many grades. Depending on the requirement of the steel, the carbon content varies. However, their carbon contents are all within the range mentioned above. Additional components are added to enhance beneficial qualities like corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and tensile strength.

Some of the most popular mild steel grades are: -

EN 1.0301 -

This steel grade has a 0.1% carbon content, a 0.4% manganese content, a 0.4% silicon content, and other components that all contribute to the steel's good weldability. Because of these characteristics, EN 1.0301 is frequently used to make furniture, appliances, and automobile components.

EN 1.1121 -

This low-carbon steel grade has an average manganese content of 0.45% and about 0.1% carbon, giving it an extraordinarily high ductility that makes it useful for various projects.

EN 1.0402

– This grade of steel is especially suited for carburised parts. It has a good balance between ductility, strength, toughness, and excellent weldability. Its manganese level ranges from 0.3% to 0.6%, and its carbon content ranges from 0.18% to 0.23%. It is not as frequently used as EN 1.1121, but it has excellent machinability in its as-forged state.

How is

mild steel

made?

Iron ore and coal are extracted and then melted together in a blast furnace along with lime, which is added to form a protective layer over the top of the hot molten metal. As scrap steel is introduced to the converter, oxygen is blasted through the molten iron, bringing the carbon content down to a maximum of 1.5%.

The mixture is then transferred to a different furnace to burn out any impurities and make any additional chemical changes to the mild steel. Degassing, stirring, and ladle injection are potential procedures that could be utilised at this phase, each of which has a different effect on the outcome.

The steel is then put into a mould and solidifies in the casting process.

Following that, the low-carbon steel slab is usually formed as needed using techniques like hot rolling or cold drawing, among others. The step is known as the forming process. Mild steel is often formed multiple times to enhance its mechanical qualities using processes like coating and tempering.

What is mild steel used for?

1. Machinery Applications –

The production of machinery and automobiles extensively uses mild steel. It is affordable, appropriate for various cutting and coating techniques, has good weldability, and offers adequate physical qualities. These qualities are advantageous for creating frames, panels, etc

2. Pipelines and Poles -

Mild steel is an excellent option for making poles and pipes because it has excellent ductility and can withstand harsh environments.Although mild steel pipes can easily be welded together, they generally maintain some flexibility. This is a crucial property of the metal since the pipelines may contract during cold weather or enlarge during hot weather.

3. Cutlery and Cookware -

Earlier stainless steel cookware used to be the only option, however, modern cooks are starting to appreciate the benefits of using mild steel cookware. The cutting tool can be modified to become a non-sticking material, has a greater temperature limit, and maintains its sharpness for a more extended period of time. Corrosive wear can be combated by seasoning the metal.

4. Fencing -

Our last modern application for mild steel is pretty conventional, but it has mainly benefited from the modern welding technology and equipment. Metal gating and fencing have always needed to strike a balance between strength and aesthetically pleasing design for beauty and character, and mild steel is ideal for both. It can be painted to create a long-lasting, low-care decorative finish and galvanised to prevent corrosion. It is sturdy and difficult to break (unlike cast iron). Mild steel may be easily forged in various shapes to fit even the most demanding designs, whether by hand or by a modern machine.

If you are looking for

1b3NafpQy0af9KeTK2gSS9,Modern Methods of Testing Steel Quality,How to Test Steel Quality | JSW One MSME Blog,Steel quality directly impacts strength and durability of the final product. Read our blog to know how to test steel quality!,Product,3 Mins,modern-methods-of-testing-steel-quality,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Steel is a vital raw material in several manufacturing industries. Steel quality is crucial as it directly impacts the strength and durability of the final product. The chemical composition of steel provides valuable information about its properties, but testing is necessary to validate its strength, hardness, and quality.

However, before looking into the types of tests, it is essential to understand some key terms:-

1.Coupon:

A coupon is a sample material taken from a master plate or produced through the same forging process, ensuring that it represents the master plate and is used for testing purposes.

There are two types of coupons: -Longitudinal coupons (LCVN) and transverse coupons (TCVN). An LCVN coupon is taken in the direction of the rolling direction of the plate, while a TCVN coupon is taken transverse to the rolling direction. LCVN coupons generally have higher yield and tensile strength than TCVN coupons, as they follow the steel grain. Structural engineers often consider LCVN and TCVN coupon test results while choosing materials.

2. Lamination:

A lamination is a flaw or defect in a steel or metal alloy material that can weaken its structural performance. Various factors, including folds, layers, foreign materials, and trapped gases during the rolling process, can cause it. Lamination occurs when the defect or foreign material in the ingot spreads as the material is rolled into the desired size and thickness. Some steel materials have an acceptable lamination threshold, where some laminations are permitted until the risk of material failure becomes too high.

3.Mill Test Reports:

A mill test report (MTR) is a document that shows the origin and composition of the material, as well as the results of its testing. It serves as a quality assurance document that provides engineers with the exact composition and performance of the material. MTRs are often included with every steel material purchase and can always be requested if not provided.

With the advancement of technology, the methods of testing steel quality have also evolved to provide more accurate and reliable results. Here are some of the commonly used modern methods of testing steel quality:

1.Spectrometer Analysis -

A spectrometer is an instrument that uses light to analyse the chemical composition of a material. Steel samples are subjected to a beam of light, and the absorbed or emitted light is analyzed to determine the chemical composition. This method is quick, precise, and non-destructive, making it a popular choice for testing steel quality.

2. Ultrasonic Testing

– Laminations can occur during the production of steel. To detect these imperfections, ultrasonic testing (UT) is utilised. UT utilises high-frequency soundwaves to identify laminations within the steel material. It is a non-destructive test performed directly on the steel material, not on a coupon.

During UT, a probe emits a soundwave into the material. When the soundwave encounters an obstacle, such as air, it bounces back to the probe. The probe's ultrasonic transducer converts the soundwaves into electrical energy, which is then displayed on a testing machine screen.

3. The Charpy V-Notch test

, also known as the Charpy Impact Test, evaluates a material's ability to withstand impact energy within a specified temperature range. The test is named after Georges Charpy, who established the standard for impact testing. Brittle materials can withstand less impact before breaking, and low temperatures increase brittleness. For projects involving steel materials exposed to cold temperatures, the Charpy test helps engineers determine the appropriate steel grade. The Charpy test involves a small sample of the material being struck by a heavy pendulum hammer. The sample has a V-shaped notch in the center, giving the test its name. The pendulum strikes the sample, which can bend or break, and the amount of energy absorbed is measured.

4.  Magnetic Particle Testing

- This method uses magnetic fields to detect surface and slightly subsurface defects in steel. A magnetic field is applied to the steel, and iron oxide-coated magnetic particles are introduced to the surface. The magnetic particles are attracted to any areas of discontinuity, such as cracks, and form an easily visible indication on the surface.

5.  Hardness Testing

- Hardness measures a material's resistance to permanent deformation. There are several methods of hardness testing, including Rockwell, Brinell, and Vickers, each of which uses a different type of indenter and load. Hardness testing is used to determine the strength and durability of steel and is often used in conjunction with other testing methods to provide a complete picture of the material's quality.

6.  Tensile Testing

- Tensile testing is a method of measuring the force required to pull a material apart. This test is used to determine the strength and ductility of steel. A steel sample is subjected to an increasing load until it breaks, and the force required to break the sample is recorded. The results of this test are used to determine the material's ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation.

Methods of testing steel quality have advanced significantly, providing more accurate and reliable results. These methods ensure that

steel products

meet the required standards and provide the desired strength and durability. By utilising these methods, industries can ensure that the steel they use is of the highest quality, which in turn helps to reduce the risk of product failure and improve overall safety."
194ELqmph7f49Z7DP9MwwA,2022: Steel trends in the construction industry,Steel Trends in the Construction Industry | JSW One MSME Blog,Steel for construction is increasingly in demand as a material of choice for making columns and beams that support buildings. Read on to know more about steel trends in the construction industry.,News,3 min,2021-steel-trends-in-the-construction-industry,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Steel for construction is increasingly becoming a material of choice for making prefabs as well as columns and beams that support buildings.  And rapid urbanisation, along with the accompanying infrastructure boom, are further driving the demand for construction steel. In 2021, global demand for steel from the construction sector was estimated to be a whopping 930 million metric tons!

Here’s a quick look into what’s behind the world’s growing appetite for construction steel and the trends in the market.

Need to put sustainability into action

The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gasses and these trap sunlight, causing our planet’s overall temperature to rise. Using the planet’s finite resources sustainably without exhausting them is key to counteracting climate change. Steel fits into the sustainability narrative quite well; once made, it can be recycled endlessly without much quality loss.  

The steel grades used for construction are, in fact, some of the world’s most recycled materials, besides being the most commonly used metal . Hence, humankind is increasingly counting on the steel industry to contribute to humanity’s overall sustainability drive. With properties like resilience, hardness, and corrosion resistance, structural steel works over a long period of time, from constructing buildings through operations to decommissioning and beyond.

Rise of made-in-steel buildings

Stone has been the primary building material for quite some time now.  But steel is disrupting this status quo. A plush apartment complex configured in  high-grade construction steel first appeared in 2010 in Rajarhat, near Kolkata.  The perforated steel skin of this property admits ample natural light and wafts of fresh air, making the habitation environmentally sound and aesthetically elevated.

Properly insulated steel buildings need less energy for heating and cooling. The alloy is resistant to dampness and soiling, so steel properties have a longer lifespan and are less expensive to maintain. Also, locally available workforces can assemble made-in-steel buildings with relative ease. Construction steel is becoming ubiquitous, and soon we are going to see various steel grades of the same deployed in metros, railways, expressways, airports, ports, and aerospace projects.

The advent of seeing steel online

In the pre-internet era,  steel plates were sourced in bulk from mills and none but tier-1 builders and wholesalers could afford this luxury. Today, digitisation is exerting a levelling influence on the market. Physical markets are rapidly giving way to e-commerce sites that present MSMEs/steel buyers with the same opportunities as large buyers. The online channels put power in the hands of buyers to research merchandise, compare the best steel prices, and consult experts before going ahead with a deal. For high-quality steel material, it’s also best to go with one of the top steel manufacturers in India, namely JSW, where you can get the best steel online with top quality service.

The steel buying process, like most other online services, can also involve parallel telephonic chats between steel buyers and steel dealers. In a few cases, the actual transaction might even happen offline and include physical verification of construction steel products. Still, online marketplaces serve as a valuable research tool for these steel buyers.

Complex purchase criteria

In the context of online buying - What product factors matter most to steel buyers? A pen picture of the MSME buyers should help us understand this. The construction industry is a major consumer of steel and the buyers in question are typically small contractors working on residential and commercial properties as well as public works (e.g. bridges). 

Since construction steel is an important component of any structural shape, its quality is a key consideration. Buyers look for important quality criteria like easy weldability, bendability, corrosion resistance, seismic resistance, and fatigue resistance.  Carrying too much inventory is a risk that MSMEs can ill afford. Rather, they would prefer small orders delivered over a certain timeframe. 

Customers naturally expect steel dealers and sellers to smoothen their process of discovering, buying, and using steel products. Customer support and aftersales are going to be very crucial for businesses wanting to retain profitable customers. Looking through endless product catalogues can be off-putting for online MSMEs. They want to be able to input a specific product quantity and checkout without a fuss, and quick order forms are there to help them do just that . Online customers are also keen on quantity discounts  and financing options, including flexible repayment terms.

Similar initiatives will be needed to ensure the long-term survival and eventual growth of MSMEs. Incentivising equity investments from the general public, prioritizing access to funding for MSMEs, and tax-friendly policies from the legislature could be the key to reviving the industry."
sVNlFMBcUF0CEuHoAIUko, Is the real estate industry set to bounce back in 2022?,Real Estate Industry and its Bounce Back in 2022 | JSW One MSME Blog, Covid 19 greatly impacted the real estate sector and brought growth to a sudden halt. Read on to know in detail about the real estate industry and its growth!,News,2 min,is-the-real-estate-industry-set-to-bounce-back-in-2022,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"India’s real estate sector witnessed unprecedented growth in 2010 – 2020, growing at a CAGR of 10% in 2010-2015, and 15% in the period 2015-2020.

But the outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic brought this growth to a sudden halt. A credit crunch for developers and

MSMEs in the sector

coupled with a collapse in demand saw the real estate sector crash by over 40% in 2020-2021, resulting in losses to the tune of Rs 1 lakh crore. (KPMG RE report 2021) With the worst of the pandemic now behind us, are we set to witness a revitalized real estate sector in 2022?

Early signs indicate the answer is a resounding yes. Experts are bullish on the prospects of the industry in 2022, judging by recent trends. The residential sector grew by 51% in the last two quarters of 2021, with over 232,000 new housing units sold among tier I cities across India, according to a report by Knight Frank consulting. Markets in Mumbai and Pune made the biggest gains, garnering over 56% of new sales volume in Q1 2022.

Affordable flexible payment plans have ensured homebuyers prefer under-construction homes over the Ready-to-Move-in (RTMI) segment, with under-construction homes making up over 80% of sales during the year.

The real estate index has also risen by 75% in the last one year, largely beating other high-performing indices, including the Nifty50.

This impressive rebound, which comes despite an inflation in construction costs, is being viewed by some analysts as the beginning of a cyclic upturn, and not just a temporary market correction.

In 2022-2023, industry projections estimate strong capital value growth to continue for the residential segment, particularly in luxury housing and commercial real estate.

But what is causing this unprecedented growth, and what impact is this having on steel demand?

4 key factors are behind this spurt in real estate growth –

Pent up demand

– Owing to the pandemic and the move to remote ways of work, several migrant, white-collar professionals in cities took the opportunity to return to their hometown for the short term. As a result, many potential homebuyers abandoned their plans for purchasing a house, preferring instead to wait for the end of the pandemic before making any major investments in real estate. With the world returning to normalcy, this pent up demand is likely to drive a major share of renewed homebuying in 2022.

Affordability –

With an oversupply of unsold inventory, particularly in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru, real estate developers are offering attractive offers, discounted prices, and flexible repayment plans for serious buyers. While interest rates on home loans have only seen a slight reduction, banks and government financial institutions are keen on tapping into the renewed demand, offering flexible payment plans and tax sops for first time homebuyers.

3

. Rise in office space absorption –

As companies resume operations at technology parks and commercial complexes in metros, developers are witnessing a boom in office space absorption. Reports indicate a growth of up to 30% in net office space absorption, with the total footage under commercial occupation likely to touch 45 million square feet by the end of the year. In addition, 150+ new SEZs are expected to become operational in the next 3-5 years.

4.

Macroeconomic push –

In an effort to catalyse growth, the 2022-23 Union Budget saw a revived focus on the housing sector. Affordable housing schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, which has now been extended to 2024, and various subsidy schemes for first-time buyers of affordable housing are set to rejuvenate the real estate market in tier 2 and 3 cities. In October 2021, the RBI decided to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4%, giving a boost to the real estate market and investor sentiment.

Demand for steel and steel products - Impact of the 2022 Real Estate market boom on MSME sector

This surge in the real estate market is not without its ripple effects up and down the supply chain. In particular, medium to small manufacturing firms that make up the bulk of the supplier ecosystem that the real estate and construction industry in India depends on, are expected to struggle with under-capacity for most of 2022. Further, newer steel products, such as

readymade steel structures

that reduce high-rise construction time and effort, are

expected to see more general adoption.

With 62% of India’s steel demand coming from the real estate sector, MSME suppliers of steel equipment, steel tubing, and steel furnishings used in the building construction industry are expected to witness a significant increase in orders and order value from real estate developers. To cope, proper demand forecasting and inventorying in advance is critical to avoid any disruptions to business and cashflows due to under capacity

. Manufacturing firms making the move to digital commerce and online platforms

, particularly to meet steel procurement demands, will benefit from faster delivery of steel raw material, fewer supply shortages, and a greater variety of steel products available online, resulting in a significant reduction of costs.

A good CMR (between 4 and 1) can give MSMEs access to affordable credit

Lenders use CMR to evaluate the credit-worthiness of finance seekers

It is also possible for business owners to fund businesses in a personal capacity via CIBIL scores

You may have heard of the term credit rating or the CIBIL score, which banks use to evaluate the credit-worthiness of individual borrowers. Just as the CIBIL score is a rating of loan-takers, CMR (CIBIL MSME rank) is an assessment of the credit-worthiness of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

Understanding CIBIL MSME Rank (CMR)

CMR assigns a grade to small and medium businesses based on their credit profile, repayment behaviour and future repayment capacity. A score towards the lower end of the scale shows greater credit-worthiness. Banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) use CMR to evaluate loan applications from MSMEs.

The CIBIL MSME Rank rates businesses on a scale of 1 to 10, with CMR-1 indicating minimum risk of default and CMR-10 indicating the highest risk. CMR is assigned only to companies that have an overall outstanding credit of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 50 crore.

Why is CMR important for an MSME?

Banks and financial institutions are often wary of lending to MSMEs without collateral because they fear defaults. CMR is an objective model or criteria to assess the credit risk of an MSME. A low CMR indicates that an MSME has a good repayment track record and practices prudent credit behaviour. This helps lenders reduce their credit risk and extend finance to deserving applicants.

For MSMEs, a low CMR improves access to quick and affordable credit. Many leading banks offer a lower rate of interest to MSMEs with a low CMR.

How can you check your company's CMR?

Follow the steps below to check your company’s CMR:

Visit the website: https://www.cibil.com/online/Company-credit-report.do

Fill in necessary details: name and address of the company, contact details of the company and applicant, PAN number etc

Pay the registration fee (around INR 3000)

CIBIL will mail you a unique Registration ID and Transaction ID. Use the registration ID to access the next steps

Upload KYC documents

How do you improve your CMR?

Improving CMR requires that a few measures are undertaken by businesses:

Bill payments need to be made on time - just as it would be in the case of individuals, any outstanding debt or credit card payments for businesses need to be paid consistently on time.

Lower credit utilisation - A safe bet as far as credit utilisation is concerned is to keep the ratio under 30%. Even if larger sums are available to the business, not actively seeking it will benefit your business. However, if you do take on more debt, pay it back on time. This will help your credit score recover in the long run.

Clear old debt first - Before taking on additional debt, clearing the original debt should be prioritised. Too many outstanding loans may scare off lenders.

Consider taking a short-term loan - After all your outstanding debt has been cleared, a short-term loan should be availed. If you repay this loan on time, it should help your credit score rise as it proves your capacity to repay the loan.

Safeguard old credit cards - Older credit cards and timely bill payments indicate stability and help you boost your credit score.

Report mistakes - Simple mistakes such as the wrong mobile number, or spelling errors could lower your score. By checking your reports periodically, you can help identify these errors and rectify your credit score.

Final note

: Enhancing a credit score may seem easy, but doing so takes a significant amount of time. For businesses that have a reasonably strong score, enhancing it is a good idea. It provides quick access to funding, and lenders are often happy to part with funds at better terms For those that have a higher CMR, the road to better funding might seem long, but taking steps to remedy the situation is definitely worthwhile."

Key highlights:

Ranking on page 1 of Google search is the key to getting traffic to your website

Great content has the potential to rank higher on Google

Take advantage of the My Business Account feature to be visible to nearby customers

If you are thinking of expanding your steel business and want to acquire new customers digitally, a website is the first place to start. But how do you get prospective customers to discover your website and visit it? The answer is simple: optimise Google search.

Billions of people use Google every day to research a variety of products and services. For example, if you manufacture steel bearings, you would want to be visible to customers searching for ‘steel bearing manufacturers’ on Google search, wouldn’t you? Here’s how you can make that happen.

How Google search works: 101

Google innumerable documents in its search index. When a user searches for ‘steel bearing manufacturers’, it retrieves relevant content (websites, web pages, videos, ads, businesses etc) and shows it to you as search results. The search results are ranked in order of relevance, automated by a complex algorithm.

Most users don’t look beyond the first page of results, which is a listing of the 10 most relevant web pages matching a query. Now, if you don’t rank among these 10 results, the likelihood of you getting a lot of traffic from the search term ‘steel bearing manufacturers’ is minuscule.

So, the objective is always to try and rank in the top 10 results of Google search for queries that are relevant to you.

How to improve your ranking on Google search?

How does Google rank a website or a web page in relation to a user query? One of the most important factors (but not the only one, mind you) is the content of your website. This could be in the form of blogs, articles, videos, etc...

Do you have content that is relevant to the query ‘steel bearing manufacturers’ or any other, applicable key terms? Is that content unique? Is it better in quality than other websites that already rank in the top 10? Is the content updated regularly? These are a few points to keep in mind when improving your search-ability.

While there are many steps that you can take to improve your ranking, building great content should be the first.

Starting your content journey

Where should you start your content journey? While there are several good third-party tools, we would recommend that you start with the

Google Keyword Planner

. You can access this by creating a free Google Adwords account with any Gmail ID. The planner will help you narrow down on the kind of terms that users type into Google. For example, ‘steel bearing manufacturer’ has lower than 10 global searches a month, while ‘steel bearings’ and ‘steel ball bearings’ have anywhere between 100 and 1000 searches per month. The planner also gives you other keyword suggestions related to your business: ‘stainless steel bearings’, ‘metal ball bearings’ etc.

Once you have a list of keywords, type them into Google and look at the sites or pages that rank for those search terms. You can take cues from those sites and create better or more valuable content than them. Intelligently written and regularly updated content will translate into more traffic and, eventually, more customers.

More ways to grow with Google

Beyond Google Search, there are many other aspects that customers may consider before making a decision to reach out. Therefore it is necessary to cover all your bases, so that customers believe in the legitimacy of your business. The first step is to list your business on Google."

Strong customer understanding is key for business growth online

From effective digital marketing to establishing partnerships, there are several ways to widen your customer base.

Every method of online growth may not be applicable for your business. Choose wisely.

Businesses whether big or small, aim to grow and expand their reach. One of the ways in which many businesses, particularly MSMEs, can look to drive growth is through digital marketing. Whether your business is B2B (business conducted between one business and another, such as a wholesaler and retailer) or B2C (a direct-to-retail or customer facing business, such as a storefront), you can use digital to build your brand, reach new customers and generate more business. Here is a roadmap to getting your business to grow and generate leads via digital:

Is your customer online?

It might seem fairly obvious. However, there is a strong reason why you should think long and hard about the answer. The number of active internet users in 2020 was about 300 million plus. That means a large population isn’t active on the internet. If your potential customer is not among the 300 million active internet users, you may want to consider more traditional approaches. You must understand who your customer is, what she does online and what her interests are before formulating your digital strategy.

Push versus pull

If your customer is active online, there are two ways you can reach them: pushing your content to them (targeted advertising) or pulling them to your content (content and search marketing). Platforms such as Google and Facebook allow you to target specific sets of audiences and pull them to your content, website or online store. You can target audiences by interest, location, keywords and many other factors. A more organic way of reaching potential customers is through creating content that people can find search engines. Search engines like Google drive anywhere between 60-90% of a website’s traffic. Search engine optimization is the art and science of creating content that ranks on sites like Google. For example, if you are a manufacturer of surgical instruments, you would want to rank among the top three results when users search for surgical instrument manufacturers on Google.

Targeting the elusive one

If your customer does not use the internet heavily or if their interests are not known, then previously collected customer data can be used to reach them. Social media platforms allow you to leverage existing customer databases. Phone numbers, names, email addresses and other data can help you directly target your customers. Some online advertising platforms such as Facebook and Google even allow for ‘lookalike audiences’ where potential new customers with similar profiles to those of your existing customers can be targeted.

CRM to the rescue

Customer databases can also be leveraged to reach out to customers directly. Since you have a means to reach out to them - email addresses, phone numbers etc., can all be fed into CRM (customer relationship management) tools that are available via the internet. These tools allow you to send marketing content directly to your customers. Powerful analytics and reports help you understand what appeals to them, and what does not, helping you hone your marketing strategy. You could always reach out to them directly via email or messages, however the chances of success would most definitely be much lower. Too many messages and emails may lead to frustrated customers; irrelevant content on the other hand may confuse them about your intentions.

Rewarding loyalty and digital referrals

Do you have repeat customers who prefer doing business with you? You can grow your database (and potential leads) by incentivising these existing customers to share information about their network via referrals. From discounts on purchases, to rewards such as bonuses, vacations, and cashbacks etc., there are many new and innovative ways to reach potential new customers. The best part? Quality leads are often easily sourced, and sometimes at fractional costs versus just running ads on the internet.

Final note:

The key to unlocking strong digital outcomes for your business is understanding your customers and their behaviour on the internet. If you know what they do, where they go, and what kind of content they consume, you can easily find ways to reach them. The final step relies on your ability to persuade them, and make the sale."
7CffPyLC6k5IB3IQIC5qca,An MSME’s guide to working capital management,Working Capital Management of MSMEs | JSW One MSME Blog,"Read our blog to explore the benefits of working capital financing for MSMEs, including quick approvals & flexible repayment options!",Business,3 Mins,an-msmes-guide-to-working-capital-management,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Working capital refers to a business's funds available for its daily operations and activities. Small and medium businesses may need more working capital when they have more unpaid bills (payables) than cash or other assets that can be converted to cash quickly (current assets). To address this problem, they can seek financing options such as working capital loans, invoice discounting, or other forms of financing, which will help them meet their short-term funding needs and maintain the smooth running of their operations.

Benefits of Working Capital Financing

1.Collateral-free loan -

Working capital financing does not require any collateral. Traditional financial institutions may be hesitant to lend to MSMEs as they may have a short credit history. These institutions may also have strict collateral requirements for MSME loans, which can be difficult for MSMEs to meet as they often need property or other types of security to use as collateral. Working capital financing eliminates this obstacle for MSMEs, allowing them to secure loans for their working capital needs without providing collateral.

2. Quick approvals:

MSMEs require quick working capital loans to enhance their cash flow. Business financing companies recognize the urgency of swiftly processing loan applications. Unlike other types of loans, applications for working capital financing can be processed rapidly. Some institutions can process working capital loans within 72 hours or less and have an online portal that makes the process even more convenient and fast. With these rapid approvals, MSMEs can receive funding quickly, enabling them to maintain their operations' smooth running.

3. Flexible repayment options -

Working capital financing provides more flexibility for the repayment of loans for small and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs). MSMEs can select repayment options that are convenient for them. Additionally, there are no additional hidden charges; only a one-time processing fee is applied. Business financing companies determine the credit score of MSMEs based on factors such as business profits, account receivables, and other factors, which affects the interest rate they offer.

Types of working capital financing –

Working capital loan -

Working capital loans are usually small loans that are granted for one month to 3 years. The amount of the working capital loan varies for each small and medium-sized business (MSME). This financing option allows MSMEs to obtain collateral-free loans based on their specific needs.

Overdrafts -

Financing companies and banks offer overdraft protection when the balance in a business account falls below zero. An overdraft facility allows businesses to borrow money even when their account has no funds. This protection is given up to a certain limit and is used as a backup for unexpected expenses.

Line of credit -

A line of credit is a type of financing that allows businesses to borrow money, repay it, and then borrow again as many times as needed up to a certain credit limit. This facility offers flexible funding options for small and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs) and can be used as needed. Interest is charged only on the money that is borrowed.

Invoice Financing -

Invoice financing allows businesses to obtain short-term loans based on unpaid invoices. This form of financing addresses the issue of customers taking a long time to pay and helps small and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs) improve cash flow, invest in business expansion, and pay their employees and vendors. Invoice financing comes with a processing fee, a percentage of the invoice amount.

Asset Refinancing:

Asset Refinancing allows businesses to refinance an asset they own to obtain additional working capital. Over several years, the business will make regular payments to repay the asset funding. This working capital financing option is available for equipment and machinery financed or purchased.

How to apply for a Working Capital Loan for MSME?

Obtaining a working capital loan is a simple and quick process. Sole proprietors, limited liability companies, and private limited companies can access this financing. The documents required for the application include the following:

· Bank statement of the business for the last 12 months

· Copies of PAN cards of the business owners

· Copies of Aadhaar cards of the business owners

· Copy of partnership deed (if applicable)

· Copy of the business PAN card

· Proof of business registration such as GST or VAT certificate.

Where to apply for a Working Capital loan as an MSME?

1. Banking Institutions -

Most major banks in India offer working capital financing options. Small and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs) can apply for MSME loans or collateral-free working capital loans by visiting the bank website or by visiting a bank branch and speaking with a representative who can guide them through the loan application process. Businesses can also inquire about working capital financing at their current bank, as being an existing customer will expedite the application process. In such cases, the bank will already have a lot of customer information available and would not need to gather additional details such as credit history.

2. Online render platforms:

Tech-enabled business financing and lending platforms provide instant financing solutions for small and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs). These platforms can assist MSMEs in addressing their working capital needs and providing other services like supply chain financing, supply chain automation, procurement management, and more.

Managing working capital is crucial for the success of MSMEs. MSMEs must evaluate their specific needs and choose the financing option that best suits their business. With the right approach to working capital management, MSMEs can survive and thrive in today's economy."
3EwbEQahCchJoI5SlLbLKj,Combating the steel price fluctuations in India – What are your options as an MSME?,Steel Price Fluctuations | Online Steel Purchase | JSW One MSME Blog,The steel price fluctuation puts MSME suppliers for the construction industry and many other industries in a tight spot. Read on to know the ways to combat steel price fluctuations!,Business,3 min,combating-the-steel-price-fluctuations-in-india-what-are-your-options-as-an,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"In the last 12 months, steel prices have undergone massive fluctuations. From April 2021 - April 2022, the price of steel rose from Rs. 55,000 to Rs. 76,000 per MT. However, weak seasonality, market corrections owing to a drop in construction demand during the monsoons, along with the government taking corrective measures means the price of steel could fluctuate to significantly by March 2023, industry analysts anticipate. This price fluctuation can be traced to the following recent developments:

Production curbs

. In 2021, China, a major producer and exporter of steel accounting for nearly 60% of the world’s steel supply, witnessed a shrinkage in local steel markets due to production curbs. This resulted in an unprecedented 5–7% rise in steel price week-on-week by the middle of 2021.

A rise in raw material costs.

By April 2021, the iron ore price had hit an all-time high, caused by an explosion in steel demand from China, India, Europe, the Americas, and emerging markets in Asia recovering from the slowdown induced by the COVID19 pandemic.

Worldwide commodity price stagflation.

Cartelisation by local resource suppliers in key markets, a breakdown of regional trade agreements, and stagflationary pressures in several developing economies around the world have hurt the resource sector globally. Sectors that are vulnerable to price erosion and margin pressure such as steel and cement are taking the brunt of this damage.

Sluggish production due to COVID19.

The sudden spike in demand post COVID19 has resulted in underutilised, under-capacity steel producers having to ramp up production, causing a lag as the required capital infrastructure needs to be put in place.

Global conflicts causing disruptions.

The war in Ukraine has had a direct impact on interlinked supply chains. In an interview with

Business Standard

, Seshagiri Rao, joint MD and group CFO at JSW Steel, indicated that raw material costs had surged for Indian steel companies after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February this year, although demand-supply dynamics are likely to play out and settle prices within a quarter.

This erratic fluctuation in steel prices in India puts the real estate and construction industry, as well as MSME suppliers for the construction industry, in a tight spot.

The construction and real estate sectors account for nearly 60 per cent of total steel consumption in India. With no clear way to anticipate future steel price rises, and uncertainty on the horizon owing to global price fluctuations, many MSMEs in this sector have no choice but to absorb losses, or halt operations. One report from the

Indian Pipe Manufacturers’ Association

indicates volatile steel prices in the past 12 months have driven many manufacturing plants to close down operations.

How can MSMEs escape this vicious cycle?

Make the move to e-commerce marketplaces.

An important trend that is reshaping the steel industry is the wholesale shift to online e-commerce for steel purchases. MSMEs have realised a direct reduction in costs by moving away from offline procurement. Online platforms minimise major supply chain and logistics costs for MSME businesses while eliminating supply shortages since the required steel intermediate products are stocked in advance by the seller’s platform.

On e-commerce platforms like

JSW One MSME

, customers also have the freedom to choose from a wide variety of products on offer, helping businesses find the steel that best suits their needs without investing time in evaluating dozens of different vendors. Additionally, credible online platforms only sell certified graded steel from reputed steel producers, putting an end to any quality concerns.

Online steel purchase also allows flexibility in order volumes, and allows for a variety of payment methods, doing away with administrative time wasted on low-value procurement tasks.

Timely course corrections to leverage governmental measures more effectively

. The government has been quick to react to arrest or at least stabilise some of the price fluctuations in the steel market. A slew of recent measures announced in March – April 2022 are expected to bring the prices down by a tolerable but significant 10 – 15% by Q3 2022.

The measures include a partial ban on steel exports to invigorate local supply, an export duty levied on exports of finished steel products, combined with a customs duty waiver on the import of raw materials such as coking coal and ferronickel to boost primary steel producers. Duty on exports of iron ore has been hiked by as much as 50%, while the export duty on steel intermediaries has been hiked by 15%.

The recent reduction in fuel prices is further expected to ease steel intermediate input costs by lowering logistics and supply costs for MSMEs.

While these macroeconomic steps are likely to give a major fillip to the domestic steel industry, MSMEs need to strike while the iron is hot and leverage the conducive business environment before a market downturn or any future policy revisions. Prices of TMT have hit a low of Rs 52,000 per MT in May. With

attractive discounts available on online platforms like JSW One

on the purchase of TMT bars, hot- and cold-rolled coils, you have the opportunity to stock up inventory before inflationary pressures cause steel price fluctuations again.

Intelligent pricing.

The steel market situation presents a good opportunity for MSMEs to revisit their pricing strategies. MSMEs typically price on a reactive basis, increasing the risk of financial losses due to market fluctuations. Expert forecasts are prone to parallax errors and biases.

Many MSMEs are opting to move to technology-enabled dynamic pricing, instead. In dynamic pricing, the cost of a product is set in real-time, with a flexible approach that helps a company that sells goods over the internet to adjust prices in response to market demand. E-commerce platforms allow for dynamic pricing, and can also help MSMEs improve their margins by introducing products with the highest fair price (inspired by the

Dutch flower auction method

). A combination of the flower auction technique with FCFS (first come, first served) can further enhance the pricing model. This can help MSMEs maximise returns under prevailing market conditions, while at the same time eliminating overspending on excess inventory on the supply side. The net effect is a significant positive impact on inventory to cash and improved overall margins.

With the advantages of dynamic pricing self-evident, several MSMEs in the real estate and construction sector have already made the move to e-commerce platforms for all their steel needs.

JSW One’s online platform is custom-built to meet the unique needs of MSMEs looking to insulate their business against steel price fluctuations.

.

Contract build model and MoUs.

Shifting to a build-to-contract model can help MSMEs insulate against market fluctuations in raw material prices. Since such contracts operate under a fixed cost arrangement (where the price is fixed against an external benchmark at contract execution), they can help insulate against future price fluctuations.

Alternatively, MSMEs can also opt for contracts with clauses allowing for adjustments to price under ""changed circumstances"" or ""fair/equitable adjustments"", with the appropriate trigger criteria laid out in the contract. This can protect the MSME against major price fluctuations by transferring the cost to the client as stipulated in the contract. The clauses could link the trigger points to external price indices, published prices, or take recourse to a certified bid cost agreed upon between both parties beforehand.

If you also supply government infrastructure projects, consider bidding for BOT contracts instead of fixed-price contracts. In the

Build - Operate - Transfer model

, the MSME is also responsible for initial operations of the facility, and all profits accrue to the business. This can help you recover additional costs incurred on raw materials during production.

On the supply side, MSMEs could consider entering into an MoU for material consumption with raw materials suppliers for a fixed length of time. With an MoU, firms can benefit from attractive price rebates on bulk orders (based on contract length), helping offset any fluctuations in raw material costs.

Recent developments have led to a pronounced transformation of the Indian steel market into a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous VUCA environment. As the saying goes, a stitch in time saves nine – Indian real estate, construction, and manufacturing MSMEs would be wise to take proactive corrective measures to combat the steel price hike in India, and not wait until it’s too late.

Agreed? Read on the JSW One MSME Blog to know more about trade credit for the steel industry!,Business,3 minutes,why-trade-credit-is-necessary-for-the-steel-industry,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"How does trade credit benefit the steel industry and MSMEs, especially during the pandemic.

Key Takeaways:

Trade credit is an essential part of doing business, regardless of sector

It allows different players in the value chain to seamlessly do business without the need to raise short-term finance

In sectors like steel, where the cycle from purchasing the raw material to realising payment on the finished product is long, trade credit is a boon, especially for small businesses

No matter what business you are in, some of your transactions are probably on credit. If you are a manufacturer, you may be buying your raw materials on credit, and your clients are most likely taking your finished product on credit. Trade credit lubricates the engines of economic activity by giving downstream partners the time to create products and realize the value of those products from end customers.

At a basic level, trade credit is simply an arrangement that lets buyers take the goods they need from sellers without paying cash up front. Depending on your business and arrangement with your suppliers, you could get credit ranging from 30 to 90 days. But just as you get to enjoy the fruits of credit, your downstream partners such as clients and customers would expect a similar courtesy.

In the face of strict lockdowns and restrictions on movement following the outbreak of the pandemic, several industries faced contractions, including the steel industry. While the industry is showing signs of recovery in 2021, many enterprises, especially MSMEs, are relying on trade credit to get through this trying time.

The formal sector does not lend easily to small businesses. Without access to short-term credit from banks and financial institutions, small businesses often resort to borrowings at high interest rates, which eats into their margins and profits. The pandemic-induced lockdowns and the consequent demand contraction have made matters worse as many of them are saddled with unsold inventory.

Trade credit works on trust and relationship-building. Yes, most enterprises have contracts and agreements, but the system works best when there’s a rapport and understanding between the supplier and manufacture and the customer.

Other short-term financing options

Trade credit is the first resort for short-term financing because in most cases it has no interest or cost attached as it involves no paperwork, is based on trust and is easy to avail. But trade credit does have some drawbacks. The same raw material can be bought at a lower price if bought with cash and trade credit markups are oftentimes opaque and high. Thus, if the arrangement isn’t a fair and transparent one, trade credit can become quite expensive for an enterprise.

Businesses often need to resort to other financing options too to meet their short-term needs. These include business loans or an overdraft facility. Apart from these, the most common option is receivables financing.

Receivables are all the payments that are due to a company in the future. And raising money against your receivables is called receivables financing.

One of the most popular types of receivable financing is bill discounting. What is bill discounting?

Let’s say you are a manufacturer and have sold goods to customer A and have raised a bill or invoice. Customer A has a trade credit with you of 60 days. But you need funds to buy more raw materials and can’t wait till A’s payment comes in. You can, however, use your invoices to A to raise money from a bank or financial institution. In simple terms, the bank pays you a discounted amount in advance and collects the entire amount from customer A. Let’s say, the value of your invoice is Rs 1.10 lakh. The bank will pay you Rs 1 lakh against the invoice. And then collect Rs 1.10 lakh from customer A when the payment becomes due.

Receivables financing allows businesses to immediately deploy money that is due to them at a later date into productive activity.

Differences between trade credit and receivable financing

Trade Credit:

An agreement between B2B buyer and seller

Allows a business to buy now and pay later

Usually, no interest is involved. Credit mark ups and related cost are opaque

R

eceivables financing:

An agreement between a businesses and a lender

Allows a seller to collect money against payments that are due later

Comes at a cost -- interest or discount"
7x9w3K2L2KFhcommU8tXR2,Why and how MSMEs are contributing largely to India’s economic growth ,How MSMEs Contribute to Indian Economy | JSW One MSME,"In India MSMEs contribute approximately 8% to the country’s GDP, nearly 45% of manufacturing output and around 40% of total exports. Read on to know more about MSME’s! ",Business,2 minutes,why-and-how-msmes-are-contributing-largely-to-indias-economic-growth,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"In India, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) contribute approximately 8% to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), nearly 45% of the manufacturing output, and around 40% of the total exports. It would surely not be wrong to refer to them as the backbone of the country.

The Indian Government has introduced MSME in agreement with the MSME Development (MSMED) Act of 2006. These enterprises are primarily engaged in the production, manufacture, processing, or preservation of goods as well as commodities.

MSMEs are a vital sector for the country’s economy and have contributed immensely to India’s socio-economic development. Besides generating employment opportunities, they work efficiently towards the development of India’s rural and backward areas. According to the Government’s annual report (2018-2019), there are nearly 6,08,41,245 MSMEs in the country.

MSMEs Redefined

According to the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development (Amendment) Bill (2018), MSMEs were classified as service-providing or manufacturing enterprises based on their annual turnover.

Based on the new definitions, MSME units will be now classified as below:

Micro Enterprises: Turnover of less than 5 crore with an investment of less than 1 crore

Small Enterprises: Turnover of less than 50 crore with an investment of less than 10 crore

Medium Enterprises: Turnover of less than 250 crore with an investment of less than 50 crore

Benefits Of The Reclassification

According to the new classification, there will not be any need for frequent inspection to verify the investment in plant and machinery. In addition, the operations of MSMEs will be completely transparent and non-discriminatory, while being objective in nature.

Role Of MSMEs In Indian Economy

Since inception, the MSME sector has proven to be an extremely dynamic sector when it comes to the Indian economy. MSMEs manufacture and produce a wide range of items for both the domestic and international markets. They have helped in the promotion of growth and development of khadi, coir, and village industries. They have successfully collaborated and worked with all concerned ministries, stakeholders, and state governments, towards the upbringing of rural regions.

MSMEs have played a key role in providing job opportunities in rural areas. They have tremendously helped in the industrialisation of these regions with a low capital cost in comparison with large industries. Serving as a complementary unit to larger sectors, the MSME sector has phenomenally contributed to socio-economic development.

MSMEs are also contributing and playing a crucial role in India’s development in diverse areas such as requirement of low investment, flexibility when it comes to operations, mobility through locations, low range of imports, and a vast contribution to domestic production.

MSMEs have the capacity and capability to develop efficient local technology, provide intense competition in both domestic as well as international markets, create defence material, and generate new entrepreneurs by imparting training, knowledge, and skill-upgradation through specialised training centres.

Why are MSMEs Important For The Indian Economy?

Throughout the world, MSMEs are regarded as a vital means of economic growth in addition to promoting equitable development. They are considered to generate the highest rate of economic growth. MSMEs have taken India to new heights via requirements of considerably low investments, flexible operations, and the ability to develop the requisite native technology.

MSMEs employ nearly 120 million individuals, becoming the second-largest, employment-generating sector after agriculture.

With nearly 45 lakh units throughout India, they contribute as much as 6.11% of the GDP from the manufacturing arena and 24.63% of the GDP from the service arena.

MSME ministry has set a target to increase MSME contribution to GDP by as much as 50% by the year 2025, while the country moves ahead to successfully become a $5 trillion economy.

MSMEs contribute to approximately 45% of the overall country’s exports.

They help in promoting all-inclusive growth by offering employment opportunities, especially to individuals who belong to the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society.

MSMEs located in tier-2 and tier-3 cities help in the creation of opportunities for individuals to exclusively use banking products and services, which can eventually amount to the final inclusion of MSME contribution to Indian economy.

MSMEs help promote innovation by offering opportunities to budding entrepreneurs to assist them in building creative products, thereby boosting competition in business and fuelling economic growth.

The Last Word:

The MSME sector in India offers silent support to the country’s economy, but the sector also needs some kind of support from other businesses as only government support isn’t enough for them to thrive. With the support from other bigger businesses, the MSME sector can boost and act as a reliable defence against global economic adversities and shocks."
2vqvpAF7OkEeDHKdM99JMZ,Digital lending options for MSMEs in India,Digital Lending Options for MSMEs | JSW One MSME Blog,Digital lending has become the flagbearer of change for MSMEs. Read on our blog to know about reasons MSMEs struggle with finance  and how they can overcome the same.,Business,3 Mins,digital-lending-options-for-msmes-in-india,Read Now,['Yes'],N/A,"Financing has been a perpetual problem for the MSMEs in India. Despite their significant contribution to GDP, exports, and employment, lack of finance remains a major bottleneck in the growth of MSMEs. Per the RBI, the total addressable demand of finances by the MSMEs in India stands at $490 billion. In contrast, the supply is only $192 billion.

There are many reasons why MSMEs struggle with securing finance, some of them are: -

1. Collateral requirements by banks and lending institutions

2. Lack of formal data for credit assessment

3. Complex application procedure

4. Longer turnaround time for loan disbursement

5. Higher interest rates

Over a while, with the advent of fin-tech, digital lending has become the flagbearer of change for MSMEs. There has been a considerable growth of MSMEs in India amidst a favourable positive environment and progressive Government initiatives. Given the easy access and hassle-free process for securing a loan, digital lending is increasingly becoming popular amongst MSME borrowers compared to traditional lenders. Technological evolution has also been promoting the rise of alternate data.

The increased penetration of smartphones, sensors and satellites has unearthed many structured and unstructured databases. Data sources like Amazon, Facebook, Zomato, and Swiggy are enabling digital lenders to make better data-driven decisions.

Following are some advantages digital lenders have over banks and conventional lending institutions.

Without financial data, digital lenders use a differentiated credit underwriting approach to analyse the borrower's credit worthiness. This approach is based on alternative data sources like cash flow seasonality and industry/ cluster risks. Basis this creditworthiness analysis, they also extend differential prices based on the amount of risk involved. In addition to this, they offer solutions suited to a specific target segment.

Digital lenders function on a vertical underwriting model. They are closely associated with aggregators who help them penetrate through segments and gauge an understanding of an MSME regarding cash flows and fund requirements. This understanding allows the digital lenders to craft solutions best suited to an MSME's requirement.

Digital lenders also perform customer onboarding with minimal physical interaction, making businesses more accessible to opt for loans anytime and anywhere.

Digital lending allows for an operating cost reduction and has a cost advantage of 20% for collections and 30-40% for acquisition.

Because a majority of small to medium businesses have little to no credit history, technology spearheads the digital lending ecosystem. Below are some major digital lenders in India extending credit digitally: -

1.

Lendingkart

– Lendingkart offers business loans that borrowers can repay monthly or biweekly. MSME evaluation is an underwriting mechanism powered by big data and AI. The tech-powered platform has a streamlined process from filling out an application form to the disbursal of a loan. The lender extends service in several regional languages. It has offices in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi NCR. Application filing is a less than 10 minutes process, and loans are approved and disbursed within 72 hours.

2.

The lending experience is simple, smooth and entirely digital. Eligible borrowers on G-pay get loan offers from Indifi, which they can avail of through online applications. The applications are evaluated through API (Application Programming Interface) integration to make an immediate credit decision.

5.

Kinara Capital

– Kinara Capital provides fast and flexible collateral-free loans of up to Rs 25 lakhs. So far, the company has disbursed loans 56000+ collateral-free loans. It has a presence across more than 90 cities in India. The company also has a mobile app called ""myKinara"" to provide loans within 24 hours of application through a three-step process.

Traditionally, loan applications were assessed based on financial information and documentation like tax returns, credit report, payment history, and bank statements. With digital transformation taking centre stage in money lending, digital lending companies can quickly determine the type of loan and interest rate for which a business is eligible. On the other hand, data sources, management, and analytics enable these digital lenders to process loan applications faster. Digital lending provides MSMEs with better avenues for securing a business loan and promoting their growth."

Of course, the quality, cost, and delivery expectations are quite high in this sector. So, a mutually beneficial relationship exists between logistics players and automobile producers on one hand and

steel metal suppliers

and

steel products

on the other.

Market participants in logistics

Market participants in the country’s logistics sector demonstrate a varying breadth of capabilities such as full/part truckload providers (e.g., VRL) and express parcel transporters (e.g., GATI). The logistics landscape also includes shippers of cross-border air and sea freight (like Gateway Distriparks) as well as supply chain service providers (like DHL). Then there are businesses like the Container Corporation that focus on rail freight.

What is holding back the sector?

The logistics sector in India is highly fragmented. Most drivers own single trucks; 85% of truck operators own less than 20 trucks. The vast majority of trucks in India

are either 2-axle or 3-axle carriers with a load-carrying capacity of 28 tons at the most.  Organised logistics providers account for less than 4% of the market and their services hardly ever extend beyond the top cities and special economic zones. Some of India’s e-commerce majors boast sprawling and tech-savvy warehouses, located on large parcels of land outside big cities. That said, 9 out of 10 warehouses in India are smaller than 10,000 sq ft.

India’s logistics spend is reckoned to be around 13% of the GDP (nearly $400 billion), a major drag on the economy. The country’s logistics costs compare rather unfavourably with the global average of nearly 8%. Transport expenses are significantly lower in the US and Europe because of supply chain efficiencies achieved by embracing smart techniques and a well-integrated technology infrastructure. By contrast, a large number of logistics operators in India make do with siloed systems that do not communicate so well with each other.

New holistic approach to logistics

The holistic national logistics policy (NLP) announced by the Indian government in December 2019, aims to overcome challenges bedevilling smooth cargo movement in the country. Among other things, NLP is expected to create the right environment that will help providers reduce their logistics costs by up to 8% of the GDP in five years’. The much-awaited policy puts emphasis on redesigning logistics processes and converting information held in analog format to digital. This will ensure more openness in terms of operations, enable continuous tracking of logistics metrics, and improve knowledge sharing across the sector.

Smart technologies at work

The “holistic logistics ecosystem” envisioned by the government and industry is going to be powered by a host of smart techniques. For instance, the geotagging feature can be applied to warehouses, cold storage facilities, refrigerated trucks/vans, and delivery persons. This generates streams of data, which, in turn, will help in easily tracking the movement of goods, location of warehouses, and availability of storage space on a map.

All this data is fed into a centralised database and anyone can access the same through an app on a need basis. Besides, using advanced camera systems to automatically capture and process goods-related data at warehouses and logistics companies will certainly drive employee efficiency and ensure cost savings. Furthermore, statistical algorithms can be run on past data as well as data continuously generated by different sources in the logistics ecosystem to predict future trends and streamline operations.

Multimodal logistics parks

The government plans to develop multi-modal logistics parks in 15 locations across the country for seamless cargo movement involving different modes of transport. Such parks will comprise container freight stations for sea cargo, inland container depots linked by rail to nearby gateway ports, and freight terminals at ports for processing shipments. This arrangement will decongest ports, eliminate chokepoints, and improve overall connectivity while lowering freight costs.

The NLP hopes to improve trade competitiveness, create more jobs, and help the country emerge as a major logistics hub. However, a lot depends on how soon the sector can be digital-ready. Tapping private investment and initiative to develop contemporary warehouses, freight terminals, and smart logistics networks is key to the success of NLP. Alongside, policymakers and industry stakeholders must continue to pursue the cause for holistic logistics with steely determination.

Steel industry as a key enabler of “holistic logistics”

India’s logistics market is on an upward trajectory. The sector is considered key to realising India’s aspiration to become a $5-trillion economy over the next few years.

Steel products

and

steel metal suppliers

will likely see significant traction in the market. Downstream MSMEs are also expected to contribute significantly to the country’s economic boom. Preferential pricing, just-in-time supplies, and other initiatives will help MSMEs get a head-start in the market. Besides, these businesses might require training, development, and hand-holding services from time to time. Mindful of this, MSMEs often prefer to work with upstream steel suppliers who are willing to devote sufficient bandwidth to them.

6A1nsdGrn28gHmV9ZEPs4H,Difference between Hot and Cold Rolled Steel,Hot Rolled Steel vs Cold Rolled Steel | JSW One MSME Blog,Hot rolled steel and cold rolled steel are suitable for diverse applications. Read our blog to know the difference between hot rolled steel and cold rolled steel!,Product,3 minutes,difference-between-hot-and-cold-rolled-steel,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Rolling is a process of metal forming that uses a series of rollers to modify the shape, enhance the uniformity, and/or improve the mechanical properties of materials. rolled steel has two sub-categories:

hot rolled steel

and

cold rolled steel

. Both exhibit distinct characteristics that make them suitable for diverse applications. While zeroing in on a rolled steel material for a specific project, it is essential to be aware of the primary differences between these two types and how effective their performance is.

Hot rolled steel

Hot Rolled stee

l

is basically steel that has successfully undergone the process of rolling at a temperature that is above its recrystallisation temperature (up to or exceeding 1700° F). In comparison with unprocessed steel, the processed material demonstrates enhanced workability and formability, making it much easier to work within processing operations.

The process of hot rolling begins with a large and rectangular slab of metal known as a billet. Initially, the billet is heated and subsequently compressed into a large roll. While still hot, it eventually passes through a series of rotating rollers to attain the desired dimensions. When it comes to operations of sheet metal production, the rolled steel is further wound into coiled rollers and then left to cool. Regarding product operations that involve other forms, the processed material is efficiently cut into specified units and then packaged.

Benefits Of Hot Rolled steel

Lower Costs

Enhanced Workability

Minimal to No Internal Stress

Applications of Hot Rolled steel

Construction Materials (such as I-beams)

Railroad Equipment (tracks and components of railcars)

Automobile parts (such as wheel rims and frames)

Agricultural Equipment

Cold Rolled Steel

Cold Rolled steel

is basically hot rolled steel that has undergone further processing to enhance its mechanical and dimensional properties. During the process of cold rolling, hot rolled steel that has been cooled passes through an additional series of rollers at room temperature. Because the material is no longer malleable and hot, a higher amount of pressure is needed to successfully compress it into the desired shape. This process reduces the ductility of the cold rolled steel making it tough for framing operations. So, to recover the ductility, this steel undergoes the annealing process. The is a heat treatment the relieves the stress on the metal during the cold rolling procedure and increase ductility.

While this specific process is much more labour intensive and costly in comparison with the hot rolling process, it can ultimately achieve tighter dimensional tolerances and enhanced surface qualities.

When it comes to Hot Rolled vs Cold Rolled steel,

the benefits of the latter include:

Superior Strength

Enhanced Surface Finishes

Greater Precision

Applications Of Cold Rolled steel

Mechanical Components

Metal Furniture

Rods, Strips, Sheets, and Bars

Home Appliances

Aerospace structures

Key differences between Hot Rolled steel And Cold Rolled steel

As indicated earlier, the primary difference between Hot Rolled and Cold Rolled steel

is the temperature at which they need to be processed. Hot Rolled steel is rolled above the recrystallisation temperature of the material, whereas cold rolled steel is rolled below the recrystallisation temperature of the material. Besides this quality, there are some other distinctions between the two materials, which are mentioned below:

Surface Quality

Hot rolled steel has the tendency to have rough surfaces and edges, which need decarburisation or other specific treatments to eventually prepare it for use in production operations. In contrast, Cold Rolled steel tends to have a smooth and shiny surface that permits it to be used as-is in diverse product operations.

Material Hardness

The process of cold rolling produces steel with much-enhanced hardness and strength in comparison with steel produced by the process of hot rolling.

Internal Stress

The enhanced hardness and material strength produced by the process of cold rolling come with greater internal stresses. These stresses need to be relieved prior to processing of the material, failing which the final product or part may experience warping.

These two primary types of steel must not be confused with the grades or technical specifications that are used for the classification of steel based on physical characteristics and composition. Steel can be hot or cold rolled irrespective of its grade or metallurgical specifications.

The Final Word:

While considering steel options for a specific project, it is crucial to remember that some materials will work in a much better way in comparison with others for certain purposes. Knowing which type of steel offers the most ideal properties for a given application can successfully prevent overspending on raw materials and save precious time in the long run."

Read on to know why welded steel tubes and pipes are so popular!,Product,3 mins,steel-tubing-and-piping-are-tech-enabled-marketplaces-the-future-for-the,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"In 2021, the

market for steel pipes in India was valued at over Rs. 55,000 crores

– a staggering 9% of the global market – with the valuation split evenly between ERW and SAW/SS pipes. An

industry report by CareRatings

indicates that the piping and tubing industry is also among the largest consumers of steel in India, accounting for around 8% of the country's total annual consumption. Buoyed by demand from the oil and gas, petrochemical, power, and public infrastructure sectors, the country’s domestic production has continued to grow in recent years, with India emerging as the

top 3 producers of steel pipes in the world

(next only to the United States and Japan).

What are welded steel tubes and pipes?

Welded tubes and pipes are tubular products made out of flat steel plates by bending the plate and welding the seam. The result is a single piece of product that can be used in different applications.

Welded piping is primarily used to transfer liquids, gases, and slurries in the automotive and construction industries. The material used may vary but steel has been the material of choice for welded pipes and tubes because it resists corrosion and needs less maintenance than other materials.

The history of welded piping dates back to the early 1900s when it was first used in Europe for water and gas lines. The use of welded piping has grown significantly over the years, with many modern applications relying on it. From the pipes that carry our water to the tubes that transport our gases, welded steel products are everywhere.

One of the most important consumers of welded steel tubes and pipes is the Indian automotive industry, where is used in a variety of applications, including exhaust systems, body panels, and suspension components. But what makes welded steel pipes so popular? Common reasons include -

Durability:

Welded tubes and pipes are stronger and more durable than their seamless pipe counterparts. They are also more versatile which makes them ideal for use in a variety of industries, from construction to automotive.

Cost-effective:

Welded tubes and pipes are more cost-effective than other traditional options, making them a more attractive option for businesses. This is because welded pipes are produced using a simple, two-step production process, and only require low equipment investment.

Energy-efficient production:

Welded tubes and pipes are more environmentally friendly than conventional seamless pipes, as they require less energy to produce due to advancements in welding and forming technology.

Let’s take a quick look at the market for steel pipes and tubes.

Steel pipes and tubes – Major industrial applications

3Djrkc9F2xMhRmFFxLsINo,Steel MarketWatch (July 2022),Steel Prices | Steel MarketWatch | JSW One MSME Blog,"Over the last two years, the steel market has been very volatile. Agreed? Read on to know more about the latest developments in steel marketplace!",Markets,3 Mins,steel-marketwatch-july-2022,Read Now,['Yes'],N/A,"Over the last two years, the steel market has been very volatile, experiencing fluctuations in price, volume, and applied taxes. The first quarter of 2022 saw a steep jump in steel prices, as high as Rs 75,000 per tonne, an increase of over 95% from pre-COVID levels in March 2020. In Q2 ’22, the government decided to add a 15% tax on steel exports, leading to a sharp decline in the price of steel to around Rs 61,000 per tonne in mid-June 2022.

Here’s a quick look at the latest developments shaping the market in the last two weeks -

1. ICRA updates its outlook for the steel industry from positive to stable

The Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency (ICRA) announced that it has changed the outlook for domestic steel from positive to stable, primarily due to rising input costs amid low steel prices.

Even if the domestic demand growth prediction for FY23 is kept unchanged at 7-8 percent, the industry's overall operating profits for the fiscal are revised downward by approximately 30% due to margin pressure from decreasing steel prices and rising input costs. As a result, the rating agency modified the sector's outlook from favorable to stable.

This means that after two consecutive years of record-high earnings, steelmakers are likely to see their profits shrink in the next twelve months. This is expected to happen as a result of trade barriers from export duties on finished steel, unprecedented pressures on coal and energy prices, and muted domestic demand growth,

as per a report by (ICRA).

In addition, with high inflation and front-loading of policy rate increases, the operational environment is expected to be unfavorable for growth in the next few months. The industry could thus be headed for a long-term slowdown.

2. Government lowers the input costs for steel

The Indian government lowered the steel industry's input costs in July, which is a win for the industry as a whole. However, the government imposed a 15% levy on the export of the majority of the steel categories to reduce costs on the domestic market by ensuring ample supply and thereby controlling inflation.

To discourage exports and boost supply in the domestic market, a levy of 45–50% was imposed on various iron ore grades, a crucial raw material. This, on the other hand, led to the elimination of a 2.5–5% levy on importing certain types of coal.

According to data from Steel Mint

, steel prices have been falling since April after reaching an all-time high of Rs 78,800 per tonne for benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel. As of June 15, the price of HRC steel stood at Rs 61,400 per tonne.

The decrease in steel prices was caused by several factors, including declining local demand before the monsoon, falling input costs, and fewer exports since the revision of export duty.

3. Impact on steelmakers

While the impact of these developments is being felt across the industry, major steel businesses are concerned that they must either pay the export levies and lose money on exports or lose global clients to other enterprises worldwide.

According to experts, the duty revision has had different effects on larger and smaller steelmakers. Since the export of steel products is primarily driven by larger steelmakers, the export duty is likely to have no impact on smaller steelmakers, while the steel-producing majors will see lower profitability.

Because of the decline in steel prices and imposed tax on exports, the steel market will balance itself to the right course to again favor the steelmakers. So, experts are bullish on the local prospects of the steel industry in 2022.

Will steel prices go up in July again?

In April 2021, the price of steel stood at Rs. 55,000 per tonne, soaring to a high of Rs. 76,000 per tonne in April 2022, a steep jump of over 95% from pre-COVID levels recorded in March 2020. However, weak seasonality, market corrections owing to a drop in construction demand during the monsoons, and corrective measures undertaken by the government resulted in the fall of steel price close to Rs 61,000 per tonne in mid-June 2022.

According to industry experts

, steel prices had already bottomed out by early July. Due to a combination of rising input costs (iron ore prices) and a

lift in global demand

, steel prices are thus expected to rise after the monsoons as construction and infrastructure development pick up steam.

Read on to know more about PLI and its benefits to the industry ,News,3 minutes and 30 seconds,the-pli-scheme-specialty-steel-gets-special-incentives,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Specialty steel

gets special incentives

How will the recent production-linked incentive scheme for specialty steel impact the industry

Key Takeaways:

In July 2021, the Indian government announced production-linked incentives for the specialty steel industry

The scheme provides financial incentives to promote manufacture of specialty steel in the country

The government has planned an outlay of Rs 6322 crore towards this scheme

Introduction to PLI

In the 2021-22 budget in February this year, the finance minister announced an outlay of 1.9 lakh crore for production-linked incentive schemes across 13 sectors. Of these, PLI schemes for three sectors had been approved in March 2020 and 10 sectors in November 2020.

In July 2021, the cabinet gave its nod for PLIs in specialty steel. Many industry insiders believe this could be a game-changer for the industry.

So, what exactly is a production-linked incentive and why is the government offering them?

The fundamental idea behind the incentive scheme is to boost domestic production by offering financial incentives to manufacturers. The incentive is offered as a percentage of incremental sales and varies from sector to sector – ranging from 4-15%.

PLIs are aimed at achieving many objectives:

Increase domestic production

Reduce imports

Make Indian products more competitive both domestically and internationally

Attract investments, both domestic and international

Create a greater number of jobs

PLI and the steel sector

The PLI scheme for specialty steel, announced in July 2021, has been whole-heartedly welcomed by the steel industry.

Though India is the second largest producer of steel in the world, specialty or value-added steel accounts for only 18% of the total. In 2020-21, specialty steel accounted for 18mt of the 102mt steel produced in the country. India was a net importer of value-added steel (4mt), resulting in a forex outgo of Rs 30,000 crore.

The incentive scheme aims to boost the manufacture of higher grades of steel in the country and reduce our dependence on imports and reduce input cost for downstream MSME manufacturers.

What are the incentives and for whom?

The specialty steel PLI scheme offers three slabs of incentives with the lowest being 4 per cent and the highest being 12 per cent. These incentives are offered on incremental sales across five categories of specialty steel over the next five years. The first incentive will be payable in FY23-24 based on incremental sales achieved in 2022-23.

The incentive pay out is calculated according to the following formula:

A: Incremental sales in current year over previous year (or base year)

B: Weighted average sale price (exclusive of tax) in the current year

C: Weighted average sale price (exclusive of tax) in the base year

Incentive = (A/B) x (lower of B or C) x (PLI rate as applicable / 100)

What categories of specialty steel are eligible?

Five categories of specialty steel are covered:

High strength/ wear resistant steel

Coated/ plated steel products

Alloy steel products and steel wires

Specialty rails

Electrical steel

The incentives are based on the category of steel being manufactured. For example, electrical steel or

cold rolled

grain-oriented steel gets the maximum incentive of 12%.

Who is eligible to apply for the incentives?

There are no special eligibility criteria. Any company manufacturing specialty

grades of steel

can apply for the scheme. The only condition is that the input material should have been melted or poured in India to ensure that the products are manufactured end-to-end in India.

The potential impact of the PLI

Total incentives: Rs 6322 crore

Additional investments expected: Rs 40,000 crore

Employment: 525,000 jobs including 60k direct jobs

Capacity addition: 25mt

Besides these benefits, the PLI scheme for specialty steel is expected to achieve three key outcomes: 1) reduce our dependence on imports for value-added steel, 2) reduce supply chain issues for local manufacturers as more specialty steel will be manufactured end-to-end in India and 3) increase investments in technology in the sector and, ultimately, enable the domestic industry to produce higher and higher grades of steel."
73Y9jVAtahNWqSuQ6BkcJC,Essential tips to buy colour-coated sheets,N/A,N/A,Product,3 Mins,essential-tips-to-buy-colour-coated-sheets,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Colour-coated steel or pre-painted steel is a bare metal substrate that has a decorative coating applied to it. This coating protects the steel from atmospheric corrosion while enhancing its strength and durability.

Colour-coated steel is widely used for applications in buildings, furniture, home appliances, and other industries. The thickness of the colours coated on these sheets varies as per the usage. Due to their lightweight, these sheets are often easy to install. Unlike other sheets, they don't bend and don't exert pressure on roofs.

How to choose a colour-coated steel sheet?

In addition to meeting usage requirements, appropriate materials can help you reduce your expenses. The mechanical qualities, substrate and coating thickness, top and back painting kinds, and performance are all factors to consider when choosing colour-coated steel sheets.

Let us look at these factors in detail.

1. Always ask for a test certificate

- A test certificate comes in handy to ensure the sheets' quality. Therefore, you should always ask your supplier for a manufacturer test certificate when buying colour-coated sheets.

2.

Substrate type and coating thickness -

Application, user environment, and durability are the primary determinants of substrate type and coating thickness. For instance, due to their outstanding corrosion resistance, hot-dip galvanised, and galvalume sheets are frequently used as substrates for colour-coated sheets for construction. A thick coating can improve durability and lengthen its useful life in extremely corrosive situations.

3.

Galvanised or Galvalume sheets -

The consumer must carefully consider whether the sheets are galvanised or galvalume before purchasing them from the market for their pre-engineered steel building project. For many years, these sheets have been available on the market. Galvanised sheets with 345 MPA, such as GI 90 and GI 120, are still widely available.

However, nowadays, Galvalume sheets are  gaining popularity. Galvalume sheets are available in two grades, AZ 70 and AZ 150. Consumers can use AZ 70 for retail applications; however, we advise customers to use AZ 150 coating sheets for industrial projects. You can explore the best quality

AZ 70

(JSW Pragati Plus) and

AZ 150

(JSW Colouron+) colour-coated steel on

www.jswonemsme.com

,as per your profile preferences (Trapezoidal or Mangalore tiled).

4.

Paint thickness -

The colour-coated sheet's corrosion resistance and paint thickness are closely connected. In general, corrosion resistance improves with paint thickness. Hence it is essential to evaluate the thickness of the paint on the colour-coated sheets. While the application and preference have the most significant impact on the coating's gloss. For construction purposes, low gloss and matte surfaces are preferable, but appliances for the home prefer gloss or high gloss colour-coated steel.

Tips for transportation, storage, and processing.

The sheets should have their surface intact during transit, loading and unloading, storage, or processing. It should also be stored in a tidy space away from corrosive agents.

The strap locks should be facing up, and the coils should be mounted on rubber pads, skids, brackets, and other accessories.

It is advised to apply a protective film during processing to products coated with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to prevent the coating from peeling off.

In order to avoid improper deformation of the steel sheets or to peel off the coating after the profile, the rollers, corrugated patterns, and steel grades should be correctly matched during profiling.

We hope that these tips will be helpful for you when buying colour-coated sheets. We have also written a detailed blog about the types of colour-coated steel sheets

6xe2s2LYZJFxnP93hVoMNm,Alternate Finance: What are your options as an MSME?,Alternative Finance Options for MSMEs | JSW One MSME Blog,"MSMEs depend on various financing options like personal funds, banks, NBFCs and more. Read on to know in detail about alternate finance options for MSMEs.",Business,2 Mins,alternate-finance-what-are-your-options-as-an-msme,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Alternate Finance: What are your options as an MSME?

MSMEs are considered to be the building blocks of India’s economy as they comprise a significant chunk of the organized business sector in India, providing employment to a large section of the population.  As per the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises, more than 7.9 million MSMEs are functioning across various sectors in India. Together these MSMEs contribute around 30% to the GDP.

MSMEs, hence, undoubtedly are indispensable to the Indian economy. However, despite being so important to the economy, MSMEs face a lot of challenges in managing their finances and working capital management. The two major challenges for MSMEs are lack of adequate financing and cash crunch.

Liquidity crunch: Around 45% of MSMEs faced extreme cash shortages to make regular payments during the pandemic while the segment had a 20-50% drop in revenues. Last November, there were close to 45000 applications filed for debt resolution. The manufacturing sector suffered the most. There were 6.3 million job losses in the first phase of lockdown and 13.3 million in the second. The unemployment rate shot up to 7.1 in the segment in November last year. These numbers are worrisome and the situation hasn’t become any better so far.

In spite of the government of India focusing on liquidity and credit policies for MSMEs, the credit flow to the MSME hasn’t been ample. As per the trade estimates, less than 5% of MSMEs in India have access to formal credit. One of the major challenges has been the reticence of banks and NBFCs to extend credit to MSMEs due to high perceived risks. Despite provisions of collateral-free loans, banks don’t extend credits to the MSMEs.

Although there are numerous policies in place to financially support the MSMEs, the small businesses often face a lot of problems when it comes to actually accessing timely and sufficient credit at an economical rate. The credit flow to them is not proportionate to the economic activities ventured by them.  As per RBI statistics, the MSMEs depend on various financing sources like personal funds, funds from friends, and external sources like banks, NBFCs, trade credit, etc.  Even MSMEs with good credit scores find it difficult to avail of loans from banks because of smaller transaction sizes and the higher perceived risks. All of these factors hence indicate the need to alternate finance options like: -

Factoring: - It is a form of receivables finance wherein a business assigns its invoices to a finance company ( a factor) at a discount in lieu of immediate money to finance the business. The prolonged payment cycle by the large-scale MSME customer has a detrimental effect on their operations. As per a CRISIL study, MSMEs can increase their bottom line by at least 15% if they receive timely payments from their large corporate customers. On-time payments help these small and medium-sized businesses reduce their interest cost and improve profitability. Factoring allows the MSMEs to have liquidity against their receivables and acts as an alternate source of working capital.  The absence of geographical restraints and collateral security makes factoring a lucrative option for MSMEs than bank finance.

Supply Chain Finance –  Supply chain finance is another way to ease MSMEs access to sufficient finance. Supply chain finance enables MSMEs to receive short-term credit against the volumes during the payments receivables periods. Finance is available at various points in the supply chain. This can be made available at the point of sale, purchase, or production and even at the point of delivery. The most important thing is that you have a good relationship with your suppliers and buyers. These relationships should be based on trust, and both parties should be able to rely on each other. If there is a problem, it should be solved as quickly as possible so that the business can continue without any problems.

Angel funds – As per the industry experts, one of the major reasons why MSMEs in India constantly starve for finances is the failure to attract private capital. Angel funds or venture capital funds provide funding during the incubation phase. MSMEs in India are key employment providers and play an important role in the overall economic cycle. However, MSMEs also should consider getting access to quality capital to not just stay afloat, but also grow and transform. While lenders like banks and NBFCs provide temporary debt, private investors provide real capital for long-term growth. Private capital will not only give the MSMEs the financial aid that they would need to address their liquidity crunch but also help them infuse diligence in processes and quality.

MSME’s who are looking at expanding and growing their business can make the best of these alternative financing options, which are flexible and can be customized as per the needs and business requirements of MSMEs."
6ceLY6oeKXw19jWEKlhHk0,Steel: Lifeline of the HVAC Industry,Role of Steel in HVAC Industry | JSW One MSME Blog,Steel plays a crucial role in the HVAC industry. Read on to know about types of steel applications in the HVAC system!,Product,3 Mins,steel-lifeline-of-the-hvac-industry,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning equipment move air between outdoor and indoor spaces to perform the function of heating and cooling. This process is termed ventilation.

HVAC is a complex assembly of systems working together seamlessly to provide thermal comfort for the occupants accompanied by indoor air quality. All kinds of buildings are required to have HVAC systems to: -

Add or transfer heat from the air inside a building

Control the humidity

Filter the air

For all these requirements, HVAC piping systems use hot, chilled and condensate water, condensate drainage, steam, refrigerant and gas to deliver from the HVAC system through a network of pipes.

The cooling system comprises chilled and condensate water, wherein the chilled water system pumps water in a closed loop. Heat is absorbed and passed on at three stops in the chilled water system.

The first stop is the fan coil unit which is located all throughout the building.

The next is the chiller, which uses a refrigerator to cool the chilled water; the last one is the condensate water system, which exposes the water to the cooling tower atmosphere. The heating system adds up the steam and hot water systems and uses a boiler to produce the steam using fuel oil or natural gas. Boiler pressure forces the steam through the piping to a heat exchanger. The heat is transferred into hot water inside the heat exchanger and is carried to the occupied space. Condensate water is collected through steam traps after the steam has exhaled the heat. It is then allowed to condensate back to a liquid state.

The third stop is the hot water system. This system derives its heat from the heat exchanger and is pumped into the building spaces where heat is required.

These heating and cooling networks of pipes are collectively called HVAC systems.

Types of HVAC piping systems

There are two types of HVAC piping systems – central plant equipment piping and delivery piping. The main plant equipment room has a network of pipes connected to the rotating tanks and equipment. They are connected to different equipment like heat pumps and exchangers over the pump room, from where the pipes transfer the process liquid to other parts of the building through delivery piping.

HVAC Piping material

Most of the HVAC system components are made of metals. The most commonly used metals in HVAC systems are Steel and copper. While copper is used for smaller piping and is very expensive, Steel, on the other hand, is not just cheaper but is also a commonly used material for large sizes. Unlike copper, Steel can also combat higher pressure and is a perfect choice for hot and cold water.

Following are the types of steel applications in the HVAC system: -

Black Steel ASTM A53 / A135 –

These light wall black steel pipes are used for chilled and heating water services of 8 inches and above

Black Steel Pipes ASTM A120 and A53 –

Schedule 40 black steel pipes are used for services like chilled and hot water piping, miscellaneous drains, chemical treatments, steam vent and emergency generator exhaust.

Galvanised Steel Pipes ASTM A120 –

Schedule 40 galvanised pipes are used for miscellaneous indirect wastewater pipes

Type 304 or Type 306 Stainless Steel –

Stainless Steel is used in pipework and boilers because of its higher resistance to moisture and corrosion, especially when it comes to the air we breathe; it is vital to avoid the accumulation of harmful mould.

Mild Steel

is commonly used for pipework and other HVAC constituents like pumps.

Factors to consider before selecting HVAC material

Corrosion –

Corrosion is the biggest concern of any HVAC manufacturer. It can be caused by acidic gases, increased temperature and humidity. Environmental understanding is essential in material selection.

Coating options –

When a coating is applied in coil form before manufacturing, it is called continuous coil coating. This process forms a protective layer between the coil and the environmental conditions. A thinner coating enables better heat transfer. Generally, there are four types of coatings – polyester, epoxy, hybrids and anti-microbial. You can select coating basis your requirements. The polyester coating has good physical properties, durability and flexibility. Epoxy will give you a hard, metallic, non-toxic finish. The hybrid coating can be used if you are looking at anti-corrosive coatings for metallic substrates. Lastly, the anti-microbial coating is a good option if you are looking at lower maintenance and easy-to-clean coating.

1OanAVZLMdxtxnZlyVrQle,Galvanized steel: An indispensable material for the future of the automotive industry,What is Galvanized Steel | JSW One MSME Blog,What is galvanized steel and how is it different from other types of steel? Read on to know the details! ,Automobile,3 Mins,galvanized-steel-an-indispensable-material-for-the-future-of-the-automotive,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"With a valuation of over $100 billion and an annual production of 23 million units, the Indian automotive industry is the fourth-largest in the world and is set to climb to the 3rd spot by 2025. It accounts for 2.3% of India’s total GDP.

A key factor in the development of the sector has been India’s domestic steel output, currently second only to China by production volume. The automotive industry is among the largest consumers of steel, with over 9% of the total annual steel production used in automobile manufacturing. For automotive MSMEs, steel offers the perfect combination of attributes - high tensile strength, low specific weight, and high manufacturability.

Among the different types of steel available to the industry, galvanized steel stands out as an excellent choice, offering a good balance between material properties, surface finish, and shelf-life. But what is galvanized steel, and how does it differ from other types of steel?

What is Galvanized Steel?

Galvanized steel

is a type of steel that has been coated with zinc. The exposed zinc coat acts as a protective sheath that prevents the steel from rusting and corrosion. This helps to extend the lifespan of the underlying metal, while reducing the rate of deterioration, resulting in significantly lowered maintenance costs. The zinc coating sacrifices itself to protect the metal underneath.

It is one of the most widely used steels in manufacturing due to its versatility, resistance to corrosion, durability, and low capital investment. It's also an easy material to work with.

In the auto industry, galvanized steel has been in use since the early 1900s, and is still used today to make car bodies, doors, and hoods. In the last few decades, innovations in the industry have resulted in the use of galvanized steel (together with AHSS) in auto components as well, making it the staple material for European and US automotive industries.

Two major types of galvanized steel are utilized in the auto industry: hot-dipped galvanized steel and electro-galvanized steel. These two types of galvanized steel differ only in the method used to apply the zinc coating. While hot-dipped GS is produced by dipping steel in molten zinc in a furnace, electro galvanization involves passing an electric current through a zinc anode and steel conductor.

Let’s now take a look at the benefits of galvanized steel in automobile manufacturing.

Galvanized steel - Benefits over other materials used in automobiles

Galvanized steel is easy to work with and can be fabricated into various shapes without losing its quality or strength. This makes it a good material for car manufacturing, which calls for intensive forming and processing of sheet metal.

When used in bulk, galvanized steel is less expensive compared to other advanced, corrosion-resistant steels.

It is much more durable than normal steel, thus requiring less maintenance. Compared to conventional steel, which has a lifespan of 20-25 years, galvanized steel can last 40-50 years.

The tough zinc coating provides high resistance to mechanical damage in transport, vibrations, and extreme weather conditions. This makes it ideal for use in cars that are constantly exposed to the elements like rain and snow.

Compared to other processed steel products, steel galvanization is well understood and has a long history, making it faster to produce and easier to use in forming processes.

Galvanized steel retains its lustre and good surface finish after long-term use,

Galvanized steel has excellent toughness and strength, significantly higher than uncoated steel varieties.

Is India lagging in the use of galvanized steel in cars?

Despite its popularity, galvanized steel is used in less than 30% of cars produced in India (depending on the brand), compared to 70% in the EU and the US.

The reason for this large gap between global and Indian averages is that the cost of galvanizing is higher in India than in other countries. This means that when MSMEs/companies look at their costs, they will have to take into account not only the cost of raw materials but also the cost of processing them into usable products. This is why 95% of cars sold in India do not provide any anti-corrosion or anti-perforation warranties, which are considered hygiene offerings elsewhere.

Due to the low use of GS in BIW (body in white) design, studies indicate that vehicles produced in India are more prone to corrosion, posing a safety hazard to drivers’ safety, and adding to car maintenance costs.

In 2018, IIT Bombay conducted a car quality survey in Mumbai and Chennai, with a sample of 500 cars across brands manufactured between 2000 and 2017. The cars were checked for rusting on their various components, and for general wear and tear.

The most defining conclusion from the study was the noticeable difference between the corrosion of cars with 30% galvanized parts (primarily Indian cars ranging from 2-8 lakhs) and those which have nearly 70% galvanized parts (including some foreign brands). When cars falling into the same year were compared, it was evident that cars with 70% galvanized components had much better resistance to corrosion and other imperfections.

Considering its short-term and long-term benefits to MSMEs, large car makers, and the Indian auto industry as a whole, it would not be a stretch to label galvanized steel

indispensable

to the automotive industry.

6fMVjXeoG6E3PHzmxxA3jc,The future of MSMEs in India: an exploration,Future of MSMEs in India | JSW One MSME Blog,MSMEs play a key role when it comes to the global economy. Read the MSME blog to know in detail about the challenges faced by MSMEs and the future of MSMEs in India.,Technology,3 minutes,the-future-of-msmes-in-india-an-exploration,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a key role when it comes to the global economy. MSMEs create a vast number of job opportunities, drive innovation, and function as an incubator for future multinational corporations.

MSMEs, which contribute to nearly 45% of India’s GDP (gross domestic product), are suffering primarily due to supply and demand issues. Moreover, they are rapidly losing their small reserves and may not be able to survive the crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic, unless they are provided substantive support immediately.

Challenges faced by MSMEs in the last few years

MSMEs, which are the backbone of the country’s economy and an employment provider to more than 114 million Indians, have gone through extremely challenging times during the past 3-5 years.

The fact remains that they have had to face one setback after another, such as those mentioned below:

Demonetisation

Flawed implementation of GST

Economic slowdown in the real estate and auto sector

Financial and banking crisis

COVID-19

Signs of an impending decline are already visible. The sector has already begun to face a huge financial burden of unpaid salaries (which will ultimately result in loss of jobs), unpaid EMIs (which will severely affect the balance sheets of financial institutions), and eventual closure of such operations. Balance sheets that are loss-making do not allow MSMEs to obtain finance from banks or NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) as per norms by the RBI, thus resulting in an increased pileup of unsold inventory, entry into the arena of dead investments, and massive losses.

What is the future of MSMEs in India?

Collateral-free automatic loans will provide small businesses with an opportunity to bounce back from the impact of the pandemic.

The economic stimulus will help various MSMEs in resuming operations by offering access to credit to help in overcoming near term loss of income. This will further enable MSMEs to grow as well as maintain the continuity of business. The long-term focus on enabling MSMEs with state-of-the-art technology also offers a fantastic opportunity for businesses to thrive.

Most logistics depend on the manufacturing sector. These options announced by the Government of India will enable them to resume business operations, thus also resuming the movement of goods, which, in turn, will benefit the logistics industry, as well.

The MSME sector has faced a lingering problem in the form of delayed payment. To overcome this, the government announced that the Centre and the Central Public Sector Enterprises would honour every MSME receivable.

Moreover, E-market linkage will also be provided to all MSMEs as a replacement to exhibitions and trade fairs. This economic stimulus will surely prove to be quite a game-changer for Indian businesses.

The economic stimulus package is primarily focused on local shops, which are responsible for the generation of 40% of employment opportunities and the driver for more than 90% of retail commerce. This will ensure that the economy is restarted from its very foundations. Moreover, it will help in building a highly locally-driven shockproof system for the future, thus fulfilling the mission of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” or “Self-reliant India.”

The government’s decision of barring global tenders from successfully procuring up to Rs 200 crores will eventually increase MSME registrations on several e-procurement sites. The Indian government’s e-procurement sites have largely been flooded by large, foreign players who bring an unfair advantage when it comes to pricing and size. MSMEs functioning as ancillary units (such as autos and infrastructure) lose the bids on smaller deals. This move should enhance the competitiveness of Indian MSMEs when it comes to government contracts. It must also see a significant increase in registrations by MSMEs and mid-market businesses on these platforms.

On a Final Note:

While the role played by MSMEs is frequently highlighted in the context of the generation of employment and contribution to economic growth as well as balanced regional development, it is crucial that these enterprises are highly sustainable and have the ability to deliver scale. Though contributing phenomenally to exports, MSMEs of India are still not regarded as formidable forces in international markets. When it comes to the future, the primary challenges lie in building the next generation of MSMEs that can successfully function as a powerhouse of the Indian economy. With fierce competition at the global level and the subsequent demands that have arisen due to globalisation, it is presently imperative for Indian MSMEs to demonstrate prominent levels of competitiveness, successfully position themselves strategically, and eventually leverage their engagement in global value chains or GVCs."
1Kx6SCEuAaLA8oJdvFCRnG,Advantages of Stainless steel for fabrication projects,N/A,N/A,Product,3 Mins,advantages-of-stainless-steel-for-fabrication-projects,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Stainless steel is a low-carbon alloy with at least 10.5% chromium, which enables the formation of an inert coating of chromium oxide. This layer of chromium oxide on stainless steel is responsible for most of the smooth and flawless finishing. Stainless steel has many advantages that make it well worth the higher cost. These include ease of use, corrosion resistance, compatibility with hygiene products, low maintenance, temperature tolerance, and general sustainability. Numerous stainless steel grades—such as the 300 or 400 series—are further broken down into various types of families based on their metallurgical properties. Austenitic, ferritic, martensitic, and duplex family groups of stainless steel are more widely used. We had written about the different stainless steel graders in one of our earlier

articles.

The desired qualities of the application will determine the grade or kind of stainless steel to utilise for fabrication.

Stainless steel is ideal for various fabrication projects due to its versatility. It is an excellent choice for applications where moisture, humidity, rain, snow, mist, fog, etc, will come into contact with the product. Here are 6 of the most popular sectors that use stainless steel manufacturing to create parts, components, and finished goods.

1. Medical applications -

Stainless steel's biocompatibility and hygienic qualities make it ideal for medical tools, instruments, and devices. Austenitic stainless steel grades 304 and 316 are used in surgical instruments, implants, stents, and hypodermic needles and are regarded as surgical or medical-grade stainless steel.

2. Food processing and equipment

- Stainless steel is the material of choice for applications requiring rigorous hygiene standards since it is easy to clean. It is utilised in commercial food processing equipment, including tanks and vats, cutlery, kitchenware, refrigerators, tables and countertops, sinks, and cookware.

3. Energy -

Numerous items and components used in the energy sector rely on fabricating stainless steel due to its resistance to heat, chemicals, and corrosion. Stainless steel is used in pipelines, wind turbines, oil and gas platforms, and renewable energy sources.

4. Transporation

- Numerous items and components used in the energy sector rely on fabricating stainless steel due to its resistance to heat, chemicals, and corrosion. Stainless steel is used in pipelines, wind turbines, oil and gas platforms, and renewable energy sources.

5. Durable goods

- Many various appliances are constructed and rely on the fabrication of stainless steel, whether used in industrial kitchens, restaurants, or a home kitchens. Stainless steel cladding and parts are used in toasters, refrigerators, freezers, ovens, and microwaves. Washing machines and other home appliances are also made of stainless steel.

6. Construction and architecture -

Stainless steel is used in building and architectural detail or design in the building and construction business. Buildings of various sizes have stainless steel siding on their exteriors. Engineers look to stainless steel when creating bridges worldwide because of its exceptional strength, high corrosion-resistance qualities, and aesthetic appeal. It can also be made from interior elements like handrails, backsplashes, countertops, and public facilities.

Let us now consider why stainless steel is an excellent choice for sheet metal fabrication.

1. Ease of fabrication -

Stainless steel is hardened, machined, welded, soft soldered, and silver soldered during fabrication. The fabrication can be complex if you work with outdated machinery. With modern machinery and tooling, stainless steel can be assembled, and fabricated easily, under expert supervision. Precise machining with stainless steel generates opportunities for fabrication in many projects.

2. Temperature resistance -

The fire and heat resistance of stainless steel is excellent. It offers high scaling temperature and strength. Stainless steel is extensively used in the fabrication of boilers, heat exchangers, and the petroleum and aircraft industry. The strength of stainless steel is particularly evident at cryogenic temperatures.

3. Corrosion resistance -

The ability of stainless steel to inherently resist corrosion is one of its key selling points. Due to its corrosion resistance, stainless steel naturally increases overall value and long-term investment. Chromium keeps the steel from corroding, whereas various alloy amounts affect corrosion in various environments. Lower grades of alloy often perform best when used in damp settings. However, a higher alloy grade is preferable around acid and alkaline solutions.

4. Maintenance-free –

Working with stainless steel has long-term benefits that surpass the initial cost, often a deterrent to the uninitiated. The life cycle cost should always be taken into consideration while making decisions. You can concentrate on an excellent process and product when you choose a product like stainless steel that requires no maintenance.

5. Hygiene -

Stainless steel imparts a high level of hygiene. Because of its smooth surface, which also inhibits the growth of bacteria, it is easy to clean and maintain. Home appliances, medical equipment, and equipment used in the food processing industry all strongly favour stainless steel.

Read the JSW One MSME blog to know the reasons why steel is the quintessential automotive material! ,Product,3 minutes and 20 seconds,how-steel-is-used-in-the-automobile-industry-past-present-and-future,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Key takeaways: Steel’s versatility and its producers’ quest for innovation continue to make the wonder alloy a quintessential automotive material.

Steel has come a long way since it was first mass produced in the mid-1850s, and it continues to maintain its utility as a material of choice in a wide range of industries.

As for the automotive industry, the wonder alloy is simply indispensable. So, what makes steel so essential to automakers? Almost 60-65% of a typical modern vehicle is made up of steel. The skeletal body, panels, doors and trunk closures consume the biggest chunk of it. The engine block, gears, the suspension, fuel tank, wheels, tyres, and steering and braking systems take up the remainder of the steel used in the making of a vehicle. In other words, an automobile is covered in steel from the hood to the bumper.

Steel’s versatility

Steel has many qualities that have endeared itself to automobile manufactures for nearly a century now. An alloy of primarily iron and carbon, steel has earned an enviable reputation for its strength, durability, dependability, elasticity and ability to resist corrosion. This versatility coupled with a low production cost vis-à-vis other materials and immense scope for innovation makes steel the backbone of the automotive industry.

The sustainable angle

Steel’s sustainability is one of the primary reasons why it continues to be a material of choice now and in the future for the automotive industry. Two factors explain steel’s high sustainability – it is made up of iron, one of the most abundant elements on earth, and it is hundred per cent recyclable. In other words, steel once produced can be used forever. You can recycle it over and over again, and it will not lose its primary properties. This unique quality to retain its characteristic even after recycling makes steel the one of the only materials that can be recycled back into the same product.

Steel is today the most recycled industrial material in the world.

Innovation and technological advancements

The steel producers working for the automotive sector have to be on their toes when it comes to innovation to meet the challenges of the industry and demands of their consumers. This has resulted in constant innovation and technological upgradation.

Over the past few decades, the steel industry has been employing a range of innovative technologies and improving existing

steel grades

to reduce the environmental impact of steel production.

Besides, steel manufacturers are also finding ways to clean up their production process to meet increasingly stringent environmental protection regulations across the globe.

Steel companies have been investing heavily in research and development. This R&D spending has resulted in tapping the amazing power of steel. Consequently, today there are more than 3,500 grades of steel with many different physical and environmental properties and chemical compositions, all designed to meet the specific needs of end users.

Quest for greener, lighter, stronger steels

Of late, steel makers’ quest for greener and cleaner steel has resulted in the development and commercialisation of uniquely lightweight Advanced High-Strength Steels (AHSS). These are ultra strong but lighter

steel products

designed to meet the stringent safety regulations, reduce emissions and deliver performance – all at affordable costs.

These sophisticated products help automakers significantly decrease a vehicle’s structural weight and cut its total life cycle CO2 emissions more than any other automotive material.

The use of cutting-edge technologies has resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of energy used for steel production today. It has also cut down dust emissions in a big way.

Challenges and the future of steel

The urgency to make their vehicles lighter has made car manufacturers explore use of aluminium, magnesium steel alloys, carbon fiber and polymer composites. But all these materials, although lighter than ordinary steel, come at much higher costs. Besides, there are issues related to formability,  recyclability, and multi-material complications in joining, painting and after-accident repairs.

Steel uses much lower amounts of energy in production and scores over other materials on recyclability. Because of its intrinsic properties, recycling steel is simpler and cheaper than recycling aluminium.

These factors make innovative steel products like AHSS one of the most appealing options for automakers. Most industry watchers agree that steel will continue to be a critical component in cars because of its strength, affordability and versatility."

Read on to know about the different financing avenues available to MSMEs!,Business,3 minutes,msme-financing-what-you-need-to-know-about-funding-your-business,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"There are many other financing routes available to MSMEs, which do not enjoy the same popularity as traditional debt funding. Here is a list of MSME financing options:

Asset-based finance

Equity financing

Venture capital and angel investors

Peer-to-peer lending

A major requirement for running most businesses is access to finance and credit. For micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) the struggle to get funding is all too real. Issues with working capital, supply-chain, labour shortages etc. are often caused by a lack of access to funds.

In India, loans from banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and micro-finance institutions (MFIs) are the traditional go-to finance options for small businesses. Many businesses also resort to slightly different funding routes at different stages of the growth cycle. In the early stages, they rely on personal funds, bank loans, and funds from friends and family for their funding needs. The Increased dependence on debt finance, followed by a mix of various new-age options such as crowd-funding and accelerators takes place in the growth and sustenance phases.

In this blog, we try to delve into the different financing avenues available to MSMEs.

Debt financing:

There is a clear preference among MSMEs towards debt financing in India. Loans are taken by firms from banks and financial institutions, often under various government schemes that aim to handhold MSMEs.

However, the debt finance landscape for MSMEs is changing. There is a gradual transition towards digital products and services. New-age digital-first fintech companies are making debt finance available to businesses in even the most remote parts of the country. Fully-digital (paper-free) processes, and rapid disbursal (within 24 hours with some providers) provide strong alternatives to traditional bank loans. Going to a bank for a loan is no longer a necessity. Just personal, business and bank details can provide access to funding overnight.

Secured Loans:

Business assets act as collateral with asset-based, secured loans. Many banks offer business loans to steel manufacturers and distributors against machinery or property that they own. Loans can also be provided against accounts receivable, inventory levels and real estate.

Equity financing:

A much-neglected area for MSMEs in India, equity financing allows organisations to raise capital against shares issued by them. Investors who purchase large numbers of these shares may also provide access to business contacts, other sources to capital and even management expertise to help the business grow.  Technology companies and the startup ecosystem have shown that equity funding can quickly ramp up business and capacity, leading to incredible growth.

Venture capital (VC) and angel investors:

Stage-wise funding needs of MSMEs can be met via venture capital and angel investments. VC, angel investors, and high net-worth individuals (HNIs), invest in early-stages or developing businesses with scalable models. Cold-emails (direct email without the right introductions) and cold-calling might seem like a good idea. However, the chances of success are low. The best way to get in touch with either VCs or angel investors is via a personal referral and introduction.

In the past, funding a business required either immense wealth or the ability to take on traditional forms of debt. This is no longer the case. Digital solutions, technological innovations and cutting-edge finance products are providing the framework for the growth of MSMEs in India. It is now time for Indian MSMEs to step up and deliver on their underlying potential."

Read on to know the 9 benefits of e-procurement for MSMEs buying steel !,Business ,3 min,9-benefits-of-e-commerce-has-your-business-made-the-move-yet,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Traditional models of offline commerce have fuelled the industrial economy for over 150 years. In today’s technology-driven world, these models are woefully inadequate at meeting needs and mitigating risks.

Traditional channels are prone to several risks, including –

Supply risks

Potential fraud

Supply crunch

Poor quality products

Delivery failures

Rogue or maverick spending (dark purchasing)

Runaway unaccounted procurement expenditures falling outside the purview of the defined process

Contracted work from vendors bypassing empanelling

Inadequate governance mechanisms causing significant losses due to purchases falling outside allocated capital outlay

Outdated technology and data causing loss due to inventory shortfalls or wastages due to excess inventory

As an MSME, it is important to be cognisant of the risks traditional models pose and stay ahead of the curve. E-commerce offers a convenient option for organisations in any industry looking to procure high volume, big-ticket goods like steel online. In India, e-commerce and procurement has long been a focus area for central and state governments, with an emphasis on utilising information technology to boost the MSME sector.

How does e-commerce work for MSMEs?

Electronic or Digital Commerce is the effective utilisation of online platforms and the worldwide web to make the purchase and sale of products significantly faster and less expensive for MSMEs.  It differs from traditional commercial marketplaces as it typically involves a closed marketplace that provides access to suppliers only to registered, verified business users.

E-commerce systems create a direct link between MSMEs and suppliers, facilitating bidding, requests for information, requests for proposals, request for quotations, and purchase orders, with the help of a web interface. For larger organisations, e-commerce portals also offer a convenient way to conduct business-to-government purchases and supplies.

Here are 9 benefits of procuring steel digitally that MSMEs across India have realised by making the shift.

9 benefits of e-procurement for MSMEs buying steel

1. Improved ROI and cost savings

The single most important benefit of moving your purchase process online is the impact it has on cost reduction.Most e-commerce systems ship with inbuilt tools to standardise and reduce administrative overheads, and paperwork. Automated stages result in a streamlined workflow from order creation to order fulfilment.With a wide variety of products and services on offer from suppliers, MSMEs can further rationalise their costs by choosing the right product mix from different vendors. Maverick or out-of-contract spending, a serious source of losses for small to medium enterprises, can be eliminated with electronic commerce. All this results in a better return on investment on the business.

2. Improved inventory control

A robust electronic purchase system empowers your team to quickly locate products from preferred suppliers, while implementing checks and balances to limit the order size or multiple orders from a single supplier, allowing tighter control over your inventory. Such systems also provide comprehensive information on bid prices and supplier contacts, helping you edge out other buyers and optimise your inventory levels.

3. Better utilisation of in-house purchase departments

E-commerce portals are fairly declarative in functionality, allowing users considerable control and customisability. This helps procurement managers better organise workflows, achieving process efficiency. Procurement specialists using electronic platforms also do not need to be as highly trained as traditional specialists, since the standardised systems are easy to learn and use from the get-go.

This also frees in-house procurement departments from repetitive, manual, low-value tasks to focus instead on contract negotiations that have a direct bottom-line impact.

4. Eliminates laborious manual work

Traditionally,  excessive hours are spent filling out  long supplier contracts and security questionnaires. E-procurement eliminates this and other labour-intensive tasks across the cycle, including building RFPs, RFQs, tenders, and auctions. With the right one-time setup, e-procurement also allows teams to fill out purchase order creation, and supplier onboarding questionnaires in a few clicks.

5. Shortens the procurement cycle

E-commerce also eliminates another major time-sink for MSMEs: Supplier – buyer coordination. A safe, dependable e-commerce marketplace can help buyers cut down on time spent visiting or calling suppliers for physical verification and inventory checks, all of which can be managed online. Due to  purchases being made online, e-commerce also reduces the time delay in having to wait for a monthly credit statement to verify transactions, which can now be done instantaneously.

6. Saves time on delivery of goods

Since online purchase orders are instantaneous, suppliers can solution, fulfil, and ship orders significantly faster than traditional channels. With commodities like steel expected to hit a supply crunch globally, timely delivery and fulfilment of goods become more important than ever before.

7. Better reporting and transparency – reducing fraud and corruption

E-commerce platforms use robust reporting dashboards and metrics, improving visibility into enterprise spending for MSME management teams and owners. Information across the purchase cycle is centralised and documented in accurate detail, providing easy access to stakeholders at all levels of the organisation.

With this transparent access to information, digital payment gateways improve process transparency and accountability, reducing opportunities for supplier or buyer fraud and corruption. This becomes particularly important for firms dependent on capital goods and industrial products such as steel, as the scope for fraud is much higher for big-ticket sizes or bulk orders.

8. Shorter purchase cycle

One of the benefits of centralised transactions in e-commerce is the impact it has on complex orders and requisitions tracking. Electronic systems simplify tracking and reporting, and ensure strict contract compliance, thereby reducing the length of the purchase cycle.

9. Improved decision-making process

With improved reporting and the capacity to handle large volumes of transactions end-to-end, e-commerce allows for quicker and improved decision-making based on readily available data.

Has your business moved to e-commerce yet?

In today’s volatile business environment, going digital is key to securing the future of your business. A key component of successful

digital transformation for your MSME

is to move to

online marketplaces for all your steel supplies

. Robust, dependable online partners like

JSW One Platforms

can help you modernise your purchase process into a smooth, frictionless, cost-effective experience, and free up your time to focus on growing your business.

This is especially true for MSMEs, who rely on quality materials to produce top-notch products for their customers. One cannot expect to perform to the best of their ability if the raw material they are using is not up to the mark. By selecting a reputable steel or material supplier, you will move closer to manufacturing the kinds of goods your customers demand in the modern marketplace. As a customer, you want to ensure that your steel supplier combines quality products, on-time delivery, and fair prices into one platform.

Besides that, there are multiple reasons why you should buy steel from a trusted supplier: -

1.

Ample experience with steel -

A seasoned supplier can readily provide not just steel for your manufacturing requirements but also a well-informed perspective about steel and its usage that could be useful to your business. Automotive, construction, and manufacturing industries need a consistent steel supply, and only a credible steel supplier will readily cater to your specific needs.

2.

Comprehensive product range -

When you buy steel from a trusted steel supplier, you can count on them for an extensive collection of steel products in their stock. This will allow you to meet all your steel requirements from one place instead of sourcing them from different companies. Besides, they offer other industrial materials and various types of steel for different kinds and sizes.

3.

Reliability –

It is impossible to meet your production timelines if your supplier does not deliver your products in time. Hence it would help if you bought from trusted suppliers because they will have consistent delivery times, and you’d be able to rely on them during crunch times when you are rushing to finish a big order.

4.

Verified quality –

Fast delivery won’t make sense if the products supplied to you are shoddy and unacceptable. Many suppliers make heavy claims about providing high-quality products. As much as it is essential to get the products delivered to you on time, it is equally important that the quality of the material supplied is immaculate. With a trusted supplier, you don’t have to worry about quality. Their products are generally ISO certified, and as a customer, you can ask for a copy of these product certifications from independent agencies. ISO-certified companies have a consistent, well-documented process for getting things done.

5. Fair and transparent pricing –

The amount you pay for steel can significantly impact your overall profitability. Some suppliers charge higher prices for their materials, while others sell at standard and transparent rates. It would be best if you bought from a supplier in the latter category to save some serious money.

6. A good network of manufacturers –

A reliable supplier will have multiple manufacturers integrated into his operation, which ensures consistency in their ability to provide quality delivery and services.

7.

Flexibility and commitment –

Different industries have different steel requirements. A dependable steel supplier will be able to cater to various sectors and deliver a variety of products at the same time without fail. They will be flexible to work with and remain committed to your needs, regardless of how many other customers they already have.

8. Other services –

When you buy steel from a trusted supplier, you can rely on them to offer additional services that will also be useful for you. For instance, some steel suppliers will work directly with you to understand your steel requirements per your projects. They will also help you by cutting steel as per your size requirements and delivering it straight to your front door.

Read on to know more about role of steel price in rising input costs in appliance manufacturing.,Business,3 Mins,rising-input-costs-and-unstable-steel-prices-a-concern-for-appliance,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"As per a report by

Statista

, India is home to an appliance market worth $68.75 billion in 2022, which is expected to grow at 5.68% annually in the period 2022- 2027. As one of the fastest-growing industries in India, the total number of appliance units sold is expected to reach 532.7 million by 2027, driven by strong volume growth in both the large appliances and small appliance segments.

The Indian consumer durables sector also has a vast untapped market for products such as ACs, washing machines, and refrigerators. For example, air conditioner usage has a penetration of only 4% in India, in stark contrast to the global average of 30%. COVID-19 has led to a surge in work-from-home opportunities, which has led to a rise in demand for accessibility and convenience, and an uptick in sales of home appliances.

It is fair to say that this strong consumer market demand, particularly in urban areas, will translate into a robust future for the consumer durables industry in India. But that is not to say that MSMEs in the industry have it easy. With broad product portfolios, appliance manufacturers are often riddled with a wide range of input costs, and controlling these variables in a profitable manner is a complex task.

Due to the price-sensitive nature of the consumer durables market, even small fluctuations in input costs such as raw materials, labor, inventory, manufacturing, and overhead expenditures can place significant pressure on operating profits. Most appliance manufacturing MSMEs report stagnating or shrinking operating profits despite a growth in sales and revenue for the reasons covered above.

Role of steel price in rising input costs in appliance manufacturing

Among the most significant factors impacting input costs for appliance manufacturers is fluctuation in the price of steel.[NJ1] Due to changes in global and domestic steel prices, the appliance business has seen some significant price increases over the past few years. For instance, in May 2022, the prices of several household consumer durables were hiked by 3-5 percent, according to the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA). However, as a result of rising commodity costs, producers were once more forced to raise prices by 4% to 5% on June 22 across product categories, including large household appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, and microwaves.

In April 2021, the price of steel stood at Rs. 55,000 per tonne, soaring to a high of Rs. 76,000 per tonne in April 2022, a steep jump of over 95% from pre-COVID levels recorded in March 2020. However, weak seasonality, market corrections owing to a drop in construction demand during the monsoons, and governmental corrective measures resulted in the fall of steel price close to Rs 61,000 per tonne in mid-June 2022. However, due to a sharp increase in input costs, the price of appliances has also increased. This has affected consumers' consumption behavior as they may find it difficult to afford the new prices.

Other factors include costlier imports, a  fall in the currency, and a  lack of availability of raw materials.

Impact of rising input costs on the appliances market

Changing consumer behavior:

For the price-conscious Indian consumer, opting for cheaper brands or choosing to purchase used appliances are two alternatives to cope with the rise in prices. This shift in buying patterns is likely to have a long-term impact on the appliance market.

Short-term impact on industry competitiveness:

With MSMEs scrambling to control input costs, fewer new products are likely to hit the stores in the next few years, resulting in less competition among appliance manufacturers.

Long-term impact on price points:

Driven by changing consumer preferences and attitudes, new entrants in the appliance industry are likely to drop prices, resulting in the market being flooded with cheaper alternatives. If existing players in the market are unable to control spiraling input costs while maintaining market share, in the long run, this trend is likely to result in a change in consumer preference for price over quality.

In the last quarter, appliance manufacturers have been forced to either pass on the increases to consumers, or allow it to eat into their profits. This latter option is not sustainable in the long run, so prices for appliances will likely continue to rise in the coming months.

Online steel purchase

– an opportunity to absorb rising input costs without compromising on price?

Traditionally, appliance MSMEs have procured steel from large steelmakers via complex supply chains and a series of middlemen. The process is ripe with opportunity for manipulation, which ultimately drives up costs that are ultimately passed onto the end consumer.

MSMEs can choose to shift to online e-commerce for steel purchases which will translate into a direct reduction in material procurement costs by eliminating conventional offline procurement. Online platforms minimise major supply chain and logistics costs for MSMEs and businesses while eliminating supply shortages since the required steel intermediate products are stocked in advance by the seller’s platform.

6QsfXoOpyn9hQydns1CZXt,The future of steel is green: innovation in the global steel industry,Green Steel | Eco Friendly Steel | JSW One MSME,The steel industry is striving to make steel manufacturing an eco-friendly and sustainable process. Read on to know more about green steel!,Sustainability,3 minutes and 20 seconds,the-future-of-steel-is-green-innovation-in-the-global-steel-industry,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"The steel industry’s contribution to the global economy is profound and unquestioned. In 2017 alone, as reported by World Steel in association with Oxford Economics, the steel industry sold over USD 2.5 trillion worth of products and created a staggering USD 500 billion worth of net value-add. However, what has been questioned time and again, is the environmental impact the industry holds.

Despite the fact that steel is one of the most recyclable materials in the world, with the capability to last almost forever, several existing methods of steel production have countless negative impacts on the environment. This includes the emission of hazardous gases into the atmosphere, waterbody contamination, production of solid waste or by-products, and more. The present methods of manufacturing steel involves the use of coal almost exclusively to eliminate oxygen from the iron ore. This process of oxygen removal creates enormous amounts of CO2 or carbon dioxide at the end of the process chain. This is one of the major environmental concerns associated with the steel industry and this has forced the industry to research and pour their resources into more sustainable solutions.

Steel Industry’s Commitment To Tackle Environmental Concerns

The Indian steel industry committed to the 2015 Paris Agreement: to cut emissions intensity per unit GDP by 33% to 35%, by 2030, to help reduce the global temperature. In addition, it has also started its transition towards low-carbon growth to abide by the national climate change priorities.

Globally, several other industry giants have invested in research and technology to discover new and greener methods of steel production. This will also create new grades of high-strength and

high-quality steel

. With time and advancements in technology, the industry will considerably minimize its negative impact on the environment.

Greener Steel Variants: Telling Them Apart

The steel industry is striving to make steel manufacturing an eco-friendly and sustainable process. However, in an industry this big adultery and manipulation of terms are bound to happen. Therefore, it is pivotal that the terms are clearly understood.

Green Steel:

The term ‘Green Steel’ may sound eco-friendly but its meaning is interpreted differently. The term is heavily used in the context of marketing as consumers are looking for environmentally conscious products. The term has been in close associations with steel that has been manufactured using world-class technology, steel that has been reused and produced from scrap, and also conventional steel that minimizes the emissions of CO2.

With so many meanings the end consumer can be misled, therefore, it’s important to ask and research which ‘green steel’ is being brought before purchase.

Zero-carbon Steel:

In order to be rightfully termed as zero-carbon, the steel produced would need to be produced with absolutely no emission of carbon dioxide. However, the bar is extremely tough to reach and practically unachievable as residual emission can arise at several points of the production. Apart from that, steel must contain some amount of carbon because only then will it be different from its ore.

If the manufacturer manages to balance the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted by taking out the emissions from the atmosphere by sinks; the produced steel will then be referred to as carbon-neutral steel or net-zero steel.

Fossil-free Steel:

Fossil-free steel is relatively, a new discovery in the steel industry. Instead of coal, it’s made with hydrogen. Fossil-free steel is produced with zero usage of fossil fuels like coal or natural gas, making it, virtually, carbon neutral. While this has been created and recreated successfully, it will require more R&D before the product becomes commonly used and made.

Carbon-free Steel:

Low carbon steel or fossil-free steel are two terms that are interchangeable with the word carbon-free steel. Essentially, they refer to the same thing.

Several, global steel manufacturing organisations have successfully, or are in the process, of moving towards a greener steel. At this point in time, the most common way is through cutting toxic emissions by a large percent.

How Sustainable Is Steel?

While steel does contribute, a certain extent, to the global carbon emissions, are there any sustainable aspects to the material? The answer is: absolutely. Steel is one of the most recyclable materials on the planet. Steel scraps, through simple processes can be recovered and reused. Due to this, and the fact that it's one of the safest, cleanest materials used in construction, steel has earned itself several green certification: IGCC, LEED, and more. Steel may not be renewable, but it is recyclable.

Apart from this, there are several other factors that go into the distribution of steel, packaging is one such example. Today, several steel companies offer recyclable or biodegradable packaging for their products. Some organisations also donate sizeable amounts of their profits towards offsetting the carbon footprint caused by the transportation of steel: a very do-able contribution towards the environment.

While the transition towards sustainable practices in the steel industry is a slow one, it’s a trend and necessity that’s definitely on the rise. Global governments, hand-in-hand with steel giants across the world are definitely emerging as pioneers in the sustainable steel industry."
1eOzwGFgBY7xNh49pkseZ6,Steel – The fuel behind renewable energy,N/A,N/A,Sustainability,3 Mins,steel-the-fuel-behind-renewable-energy,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Energy transformation is happening all around the world, and renewable energy is at the center of this transformation, for a less carbon-intensive society. Renewable energy is becoming a strategic priority across nations and heavy investments are being made in this field. Solar, wind, geothermal and hydro are the main renewable energy types, out of which solar and wind energy have a very high percentage of investments

This puts steel at the center stage of this transition since steel is the most intensively used material for building the infrastructure that underpins renewable energy production. Steel plays a vital role in cultivating all sorts of renewable energies, especially solar and wind. It occupies an excellent position in converting solar energy into electricity, as well as hot water and serves as a base for solar thermal panels, heat exchangers, tanks, and pumps.

Each new megawatt (MW) of solar power requires between 35-45 tons of steel and each new megawatt of wind power requires between 120-180 tons of steel.

Solar Industry – Types and Scale of Production

The solar market is divided into three areas – Utility-Scale, Commercial and Residential.

Utility-scale projects -

A utility-scale project is a solar energy project which produces at least 10 MW of energy. India installed 41.7GW of cumulative utility-scale solar capacity as of Dec. 31, 2021. It has another 44.6GW in the pipeline. That translates into a requirement of around 1.3 lakh tons of steel in the coming years. These projects are the largest consumers of steel and produce a standard 100-300 MW of solar energy in usual cases, however, some developments are now targeting an energy generation of 1000 MW.  These projects cater to utility companies.

Commercial and Industrial (C&I) solar projects –

The most common types of installation for commercial and industrial projects are ground-mounted and rooftop solar systems. The size of these projects tends to be smaller than the utility-scale projects, ranging between 1-2 MW. C&I projects supply power to corporate organizations and industrial plants.

Residential solar projects –

Although these projects are the smallest in size when compared to their utility and C&I counterparts, the residential sector is the fastest-growing solar project segment. The scale of these projects ranges from 5-20 kilowatts. The participants are generally homeowners, contractors, installers, and solar energy equipment manufacturers.

Stainless steel

is a perfect choice for solar panel frames because it is dense, high in strength, and has the highest corrosion resistance than other light metals. From ancillary components like frames, fasteners, and connectors, or the solar roof panels or the downstream equipment like tanks and heat exchangers, stainless steel has a role to play. Stainless steel can also endure harsh environments with extreme heat and sunlight for many years. Most solar plants are designed to last a lifetime, which makes stainless steel material of choice, yet again. It has a long life and excellent recyclability and at the end of the life cycle, 100% of the stainless steel can be reused.

Wind Energy

The rapid growth in wind energy installations in India over the last decade and increasing wind turbine sizes is resulting in the wind industry doubling its steel consumption. The wind energy sector in India is divided into two onshore and offshore farms, both of which are fabricated from steel. While onshore wind farms are relatively small and generate around 2-3 MW of power per turbine, offshore farms are much larger with each turbine generating power of around 5-8 MW. Steel is critical for both onshore and offshore wind turbines, making up 20% and 90% of the turbine mass respectively.

An average wind turbine consumes around 140 tons of steel is used. From the tower to the screws and studs, every part of a wind turbine depends on iron and steel. The majority of steel is used to make the tower, which is the foundation on which the blades turn to generate energy. There are different types of towers such as steel-concrete hybrid towers, steel truss towers, and steel lattice towers. However, 90% of the wind towers are tubular steel towers. Steel’s non-corrosive properties maximise the lifetime of wind turbines and minimise maintenance costs. Steel provides a strong base to support the height and heavy weight of the turbine. Steel is also flexible enough material that allows prevents the tower from breaking.

Apart from the tubular towers, there are other types of towers with varied proportions of steel:

Lattice Towers:

- These towers use welded steel instead of

steel sheets

. The advantage of lattice towers is that they are extremely cost efficient as compared to tubular towers since they use just about half as much material as tubular towers. Yet they are as stiff and reliable as tubular towers. However, aesthetically the lattice towers are at a disadvantage. In terms of visual appearance, lattice towers lag far behind tubular towers.

Bolted Steel Towers:

The bolted steel towers are made up of several tower sections made out of steel shells, mounted on top of each other. The sections are assembled on the site. The steel shells are bent steel plates, which are bolted together with tension-controlled bolts to form the tower. Bolted steel towers allow for very tall heights and are easy to erect. These towers also require very low maintenance throughout their lifetime

Steel hybrid Towers:

These towers are made up of concrete and steel. The lower part of the traditional steel tubular tower is replaced with the concrete segment. This design offers the greatest strength and longevity for wind power generation but is limited to onshore applications.

Whatever the source of energy, steel has a vital role to play in energy production as well as distribution besides improving energy efficiency. The steel industry is really a pioneer in sustainable practices and environmental protection. Whether it is serving as a base for thermal panels, heat exchanges, tanks, and, pumps, or being the primary material for the turbines used in wind energy systems, steel is imperative.

Key Highlights

Go through your workflows and production data to find potential causes of bottlenecks

RFID and advanced analytics are just two technologies playing a key part in the evolution of the steel industry

Machinery and technology may be important but an efficient workforce creates winning solutions

Businesses that master demand forecasting can control their destiny

Efficiently managed factories are more productive, profitable, and have happier employees. Not surprisingly, manufacturers are constantly looking for ways to improve efficiency across their production processes.

Here are a few strategies that can go a long way towards making your manufacturing plant more efficient.

Streamline your workflow

A manufacturing plant needs to function like clockwork. Multiple processes and production lines must work in harmony, with one process taking off when another one ends. Bottlenecks in any part of the manufacturing unit can have a cascading impact. For example, a delay in the supply of raw material can throw the entire production cycle out of gear, and lead to losses.

One of the ways to improve efficiency is to closely track and review your workflows. Analyse your production data to pinpoint areas of concern or flag potential bottlenecks. Look at different aspects of your workflow, including human resources, machinery, technology, and processes. Is one shift more efficient than the other? What makes it so? Is one line more productive than another? Is there a lot of downtime on a particular piece of machinery?

Systems such as MES (Manufacturing Execution System) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) are designed to help managers and decision-makers optimise workflows on the shop floor and improve production. Research needs to be conducted to find the right tool for your organisation, as each tool has its advantages and disadvantages.

Invest in technology

Technology is a powerful enabler of efficiency. If you are looking at growth and scale, you must invest in upgrading your equipment and plants. The steel industry globally is increasingly investing in automation. Manufacturers are using sensors, information technology, industrial robots, and AI to significantly improve productivity and quality and reduce costs and time.

Technologies such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) are helping manufacturers maintain optimal inventory levels and reduce costs of inventory management. They leverage digital data stored in RFID tags and codes to identify individual items. By scanning RFID, organisations can keep track of inventory levels, sales, inventory gaps, and sale patterns.

Quality employee training

Investments in technology without corresponding investments in training your employees and upgrading their skills could be counterproductive. While it is important to train employees on operating specific pieces of equipment, do not ignore coaching the workforce on broader concepts such as workflow management, information technology, and time management.

It is equally important to train employees in quality improvement and safety measures. A single quality or safety incident can hurt the reputation of a company. Organisations can invest in seminars and training sessions from experts in various disciplines to up-skill the workforce and ensure that the same language and ethos permeates throughout the organisation at various levels.

Manage your inventory

Maintaining optimal inventory levels is a fine art – it requires a deep understanding of not only your own production processes but also an insight into the supply chain dynamics and customer demand. The task is challenging, as managers must hold enough inventory to ensure smooth production while minimizing the risks and costs of stocking too much. Techniques such as just-in-time inventory management, and minimum order quantity must be studied and assessed by individual benefits to identify the right fit for an organisation. Many steel units use predictive analytics and supply chain software to streamline their inventory control processes. These systems automatically alert managers of expected supply chain bottlenecks and delays. Demand forecasting, based on historical data, can also help steel units optimise inventory. Forecasting can tell you, for example, how many units of your product customers are likely to buy in the next three months. Based on this data, you can plan your inventory and production cycles.

Mastering demand forecasting and regulated inventory management is the path to optimising your plant’s productivity. The best way to do this is by staying is by upgrading and updating your systems on a regular basis."

Read our blog to know more about structural steel!",Product,3 Mins,advantages-of-building-steel-structures,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Steel is one of the most widely used

construction materials

in the world. A structure cannot withstand seismic shocks such as earthquakes and other natural disasters without steel. Steel provides a more robust framework for the building and adds tensile strength to the concrete. Steel is also used in many non-structural applications in construction, like heating and cooling equipment and interior ducting. Internal fixtures and fittings, such as shelving and stairs, are also steel-made. It is a great collaborator that works together with all other construction materials.

Why is steel used so much in the construction of any building? Continue reading to find out.

Reliability –

Buildings made from steel are incredibly dependable. The reasons for this dependability are uniformity and consistency in its properties, better quality control due to factory manufacturing, elasticity, and ductility. For instance, when various specimens of a steel type are evaluated in a laboratory, the variation is much lesser than in other materials like concrete and wood.

Lightweight -

Steel is not only robust but also a lightweight construction material. This is attributed to steel's stiffness and high strength. Steel is also easy to transport. Its high strength-to-weight ratio simplifies the design of a structure's foundation and other structural support systems. However, steel needs to be firmly bolted to the foundations to avoid blowing away the material by the wind.

Versatility -

If there is any material that one can get creative with, it is steel. Steel lets you change anything you like since the walls attached to steel framing are simple to remove, making renovation easier. With steel, you can also create free-form combinations or segmented curves. If you have steel beams installed, you don't need interior supporting walls, allowing your building to be used for anything you'd like. You can break up the space by adding interior walls to divide the room, and you can tear them down when you decide to change something.

4. Durability –

Steel needs little to no maintenance. It can withstand earthquakes, high winds, fire, and other seismic activities. Steel buildings are also more resistant to weather and moisture. However, that depends on the carbon content of the steel material you use for construction. A powder treatment or hot zinc coating can help enhance corrosion resistance.

5. Quick construction time

– Steel allows you to save an immense amount of time during construction, especially if your project is time-bound, by incorporating pre-engineered structural designs. Pre-engineered buildings can be installed in one-third of the time taken to complete the erection of a traditional building. Moreover, the fabrication process undergoes quality control, so one doesn't have to worry about human errors.

6. Ductility -

A material's ductility is defined as its ability to endure significant deformation without breaking under high tensile pressures. Steel, by this definition, is highly ductile. This property of steel allows the steel to deform without collapse or even bend out of shape if there is a risk of breakage, thus giving a warning to the residents or occupants of a home or a building to vacate in time. Besides breakdown of steel structures doesn’t happen over time and steel structures rarely collapse.

7. Temporary Construction -

Steel construction is always chosen for portable buildings. The structures are readily disassembled by removing a few bolts, and the components are transported to other locations for the structure's simple reassembly.

Consider how different our world would be today if there were no steel-based structures and buildings. There wouldn't be any skyscrapers poking out of the skies, and the tallest buildings would only have a few hundred stories. The safety and durability of such buildings would be another question, as only a few could withstand earthquakes or fires. Steel is the ideal building material thanks to a unique mix of the above-stated characteristics. Steel is also an excellent building material when it comes to withstanding natural disasters. A building’s strength, life, stability, and resistance to disasters, all depend on the steel deployed in its construction. Therefore, it is essential that the steel used in any building is quality tested and certified. Shop for premium quality

Read on to know more about steel wire rods!,Automotive,3 Mins,steel-wire-rods-linchpins-of-the-automotive-industry,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Wire-rods in the automobile industry – Vital to success?

When you think of

wire rods

, you would probably not picture them being used extensively in the automotive industry. Unlike steel plates, sheets, and rolls, wire rods are rarely in the spotlight as these are not big-ticket purchases with the high order value.

But for over a century, wire rod products have been a critical component in automobile manufacturing.

Each year, the automobile industry utilises more than 2 billion tonnes of steel wire.

Steel wire rods

are processed into parts that are utilised in the development of the steering and suspension systems, tire cords, and bearings. They are highly versatile, finding application in every part of an automobile, from transmission and fuel injection components to brakes, fasteners, shock springs, and exhaust systems (yes, even in engines).

To attain the desired qualities, wire rods are frequently combined with other types of steel, creating what are known as composite steels. This is because each application has a very specific strength and performance requirements. Steel wire rods can thus be classified based on the type of steel used, which include –

Alloy steel (83%) – Steel alloys with various metals, including titanium, chromium, magnesium

Carbon steel (7.3%)

Stainless steel

(9.7%)

Without further ado, let’s now take a look at some important applications of wire rods in the automotive industry.

4 key applications of steel wire rods in cars and two-wheelers

Application in manufacturing the sensitive components of an automobile

Steel wire rods are used to fabricate sensitive components such as steering wheels, engine mounts/mountings, transmission gears, suspensions, and many others. These parts of the car are ""sensitive"" because they are required to withstand mechanical stress or vibrations, and are essential to the car's safe operation. All of these components require expensive manufacturing and testing.

Steel wire rods are an excellent choice in the manufacture of sensitive auto components as they cost less than other alloy materials, while offering greater strength, flexibility, and the capacity to maintain their shape even at extremely hot or cold temperatures.

For the production of such components, medium and high carbon steel wire rods are typically preferred.

Application in automobile electronic components

Steel wire rods are used extensively in automotive electronics. Thin, lightweight, and excellent conductors, steel wire rods are used to create circuit connections between different electrical components, and to facilitate the flow of electricity throughout circuits. Some examples include -

Connecting the battery cable to the starter motor or alternator

Manufacture of filler wire used in motors and electrical components

Connecting electrical components like circuit breakers, ignition coils, spark plugs, etc.

Wiring up an electrical system (engine, lighting, and so on).

Application in chassis structural elements, and interconnections

Chassis design and development is one of the most demanding stages in car-making due to its inherent manufacturing complexity, and its importance in vehicle safety. Steel wire rods are used in the more intricate parts of chassis design, as well as its interconnecting components. Wire rods made of medium-carbon, high-carbon, and stainless steel are used for this purpose.

Steel wire rods are preferred in chassis manufacturing over other materials and alloys due to the following reasons -

Greater adaptability, which enables the creation of intricate shapes with minimal waste.

They are lightweight compared to other metals (about half as heavy)

A higher strength-to-weight ratio leads to less distortion during bending

Wire rods have strong resilience to wear and fatigue, which reduces cracks and deformation.

They are less expensive per unit weight, which lowers the cost of production and testing.

The wire rod has a low friction coefficient and is also non-corroding.

They are excellent materials because they make assembly simpler—there is no need to drill holes through each piece. This means that you can produce your product faster and at a lower cost.

Application in auxiliary automotive components

–

The automobile industry also uses wire rods in the manufacture of tire cords, wheel bearings, pistons, brake drums, brake lining rod electrodes, fastening (bolts, nuts, screws, etc.), ropes, wires, and other components.

For these applications, the steel grade utilised varies depending on the required mechanical characteristics of the end product. Commonly utilised steel types include

low-carbon, medium-carbon

, high-carbon, and alloys.

With its versatility, ease of use, and ready availability,

steel wire rods

play a key role in automobile manufacturing. If you’re an MSME supplying the automotive industry, consider

Read how automotive Industry in India is the driver behind the growing steel sector .,Technology,4 minutes and 30 seconds,how-car-sales-are-accelerating-the-steel-sector,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"As of 2020, India was the world’s fifth-largest auto market, producing more than 22 million vehicles. This included two wheelers, three wheelers, quadricycles, passenger vehicles, and commercial vehicles. In 2019, multiple issues caused India’s auto economy to contract. Key among these were regulatory, rising input costs, semiconductor shortages, taxation, insufficient credit, and reduced spend on non-essentials. Even as the industry scrambled to offset this slowdown, the Covid-19 pandemic struck unexpectedly in two back-to-back waves.

India’s auto sector - gaining momentum

By August 2021, improved vaccination rates and preventive measures paid off and the devastating coronavirus is in a recession. As the rest of the Indian economy opened up progressively and the supply chain crisis in the auto sector eased up a bit, car sales also began emerging out of the slump.

Between September and October 2021, car makers posted a 40.1 percent growth in sales. The country’s passenger vehicle (cars, utility vehicles, vans) market is poised to hit 5 million-plus units by the end of 2024. Cars represent a major chunk of the passenger market.

Global automakers increasingly see India as a promising destination for automotive engineering design services (AEDS), especially for compact cars. This segment is expected to grow further on the back of growing acceptance of Indian engineering skills and government incentives. Battery electric and hydrogen fuel vehicles, as well as other advanced mobility options are also on the government’s agenda.

New incentives for auto industry

The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for automotive and auto components, announced this September is expected to increase India's share of the global automotive pie, apart from adding more jobs, in the next five years. The initiative incentivizes auto OEMs and component manufacturers working on advanced technology products and aims to attract fresh investments to these sectors over the next five years. Overall, these PLI incentives are expected to boost the production and export of advanced vehicles. New vehicle sales will also experience potential tailwinds from the vehicle scrappage policy announced by the government. As per the new policy, old, faulty and polluting commercial and passenger vehicles will be marked for deregistration. Besides, under the Automotive Mission Plan, both the government and auto industry envision a three-fold rise in the industry’s revenue in the next five years.

Currently the auto sector contributes 7.1 percent of India’s GDP; the plan will increase this contribution to 12 percent as well as add millions of jobs in the sector. India aspires to be a $5 trillion economy by 2025, and the automotive sector is key to this growth.

Demand for high-strength auto steel

While alternatives materials (plastic, aluminum, composites) have been suggested from time to time for use in car manufacture,

stainless steel

remains the most preferred raw material across the world. And this has been the case for almost a century now. The reasons being its high-strength, durability, and reliability.

At a per-unit-level, nearly 840kg of steel goes into each compact car. On average, this alloy accounts for 60% of a vehicle’s weight. Most of this steel is used in the body, closures, and

vehicle frame

, including powertrain, engine, tires, and suspension system components. Not surprisingly, the automotive industry contributes about 10-12% of the overall steel demand in India. The majority of new vehicles use

advanced high strength steels

.

Need for steel industry to scale production

A thriving industry like the automotive sector needs a steady and timely supply of high-quality

automotive steel

. The country's steel production capacity stands at 143.91 million tons; the private sector accounts for more than four-fifths of this output. The top steel producers, including private and public sector players, have significant throughputs, with respect to automotive steel

of every variety – light, mid, and high-strength. It’s certainly one of those win-win scenarios.

In order to make the best use of this favorable circumstance in the

steel marketplace

, India’s steel manufacturers would need to ramp up production by a factor of 2 or even 3 in order to keep pace with the auto sector that is gunning for growth. Apart from streamlining production, it’s important that steel industry participants offer comprehensive solutions that address all of their clients’ steel requirements. After all, one size doesn’t fit all.  For instance, MSMEs have

high quality, cost and delivery expectations

. They like to work with steel solution providers who can also provide after-sales insights and inputs.  So, the industry definitely needs to do a lot more in order to exceed the demands of various clients, especially micro, small and medium businesses.

Focus on sustainability

While pursuing rapid growth, steel makers need to embrace eco-friendly initiatives that will help make the industry more sustainable. At JSW, we design products keeping in mind the need to protect the environment and reduce consumption of scarce natural resources. By its very nature, steel is a one-of-its-kind sustainable material. Once it is made, it can be recycled, almost infinitely. Even so, we are committed to continuously pushing the envelope of possibility in the sustainability area.

More recently,

electrical grade steel developed by our researchers

is helping reduce power losses and our greenhouse gas footprint. Our Platina tinplate steel, another recent product, is targeted at the packaging industry and is considered a better and sustainable alternative to single-use plastic. For context, India has pledged to eliminate single-use plastics by 2022."

Read the JSW One MSME blog to know in detail about the steel making process!,Product,4 minutes,the-journey-of-steel-from-start-to-finish,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"The entire process of converting raw materials into

finished stainless steel

is quite a lengthy one, but it can be simplified and broken down into six primary steps. Let’s look at these interesting steelmaking process steps.

1. Producing iron

Iron ore, when mined, is a combination of iron with oxygen and several other unwanted substances, which are known as gangue. To produce pure steel, the products that are involved in the steel making process (such as iron ore, coke and lime) must be converted into iron. All these raw materials are placed in a blast furnace and Corex furnace and further melted down to produce hot metal or molten iron. Besides bulk iron ore, prepared burden (such as sinter and pellets) is also fed into the furnace. At this point too, the iron contains several impurities, which need to be removed to make sure that the metal is not brittle. To achieve this, metallic iron is then passed to the steelmaking process as a liquid at nearly 1450°C. This iron is known as hot metal or pig iron.

2. Primary steelmaking

During the process of refining iron to produce steel, the carbon content of hot metal is successfully lowered, generally to less than 1% through an oxidation process in a BOF or Basic Oxygen Steelmaking Furnace. Post completion of this, alloys are added to the furnace to attain the needed chemical composition of the end product in a Ladle Refining Furnace. The content of chemicals is controlled very meticulously during this stage. Previously, most steels were produced through processes such as the bessemer and open Hearth. But these have now been replaced by ultramodern processes such as basic oxygen steelmaking. To remove all impurities, the molten metal is further infused with scrap steel. Oxygen too will be forced through the furnace, which gets rid of carbon and several other impurities. When it comes to electric furnaces, electricity needs to be forced through the furnace, achieving identical results. De-gassing is the ultimate step in steelmaking, wherein all the gaseous particles are eventually removed in the presence of a vacuum atmosphere. After completion of this process, we now have raw steel.

3. Secondary steelmaking

The different grades of available steel are used for different purposes. The grading depends on which elements are still present in the metal, such as carbon dioxide. Most of the carbon will be eventually removed, but it will be substituted by aluminium to produce drawing quality steel. To produce structural steel, additional carbon is left inside, and this imparts greater tensile strength to the steel. Specific techniques can be successfully implemented to change the level of impurities left behind, including stirring, increasing or decreasing the temperature, removing all gasses and ladle injection. When this process is complete and the right grade has been accomplished, the next step can be carried about.

4. Continual casting

In this step, molten steel is cast into cooling moulds. This enables hardening of the steel, following which the steel is drawn out while it is still hot. Guided rollers are then used to pull it out. The steel is then accurately cut into the needed lengths. This steel can be then used to produce billets, beams and slabs, among others. When the parts are completely cooled, they are then sent for a further rolling process known as primary forging.

5. Primary forging

During this process, the rough-cast items are precisely formed into the desired shapes through hot rolling, which gets rid of any defects in the shape and delivers the desired quality levels. The cast steel can be efficiently rolled in successive steps to produce one of the many desired shapes of steel. Of all the shaping methods, rolling is the most common. The precise amount of work to which steel is subjected to along with the temperature during rolling will significantly determine its physical characteristics - whether the steel can successfully be bent, cut, machined, or formed into pipes, tubes or wires. The process of hot rolling can be used to produce seamless tubing, a wide range of bespoke items, and long and flat products. Rolled steel that is produced from slabs is known as flat steel products whereas that produced from billets/blooms is known as long steel products.

6. Secondary forging

To accomplish the final desired shape of steel, there are numerous secondary techniques that can be put into practice such as coating, thermal treating, joining, pressing, drilling, machining and riveting.

This is the entire journey of steel from start to finish.

Let’s now look at some of the diverse types of steel products.

Flat steel products

Flat steel is further categorised into three categories based on the type of process involved: (1)

Hot Rolled Steel

(HR), (2)

Cold Rolled Steel

(CR), and (3)

Coated Steel

.

Hot rolled steel products

To produce

hot rolled steel products

, slabs will be thoroughly rolled in a Hot Strip Mill or HSM. The relative plasticity of steel at temperatures that fall between 800°C and 1200°C (which is above the recrystallisation temperature) makes it possible to successfully roll steel into a wide range of useful shapes, while simultaneously enhancing its mechanical properties. Usually, the more the steel is hot rolled, the tougher and denser it becomes.

HR Coil

ranges from 1.6-25 mm in thickness and is produced in HSM. HR coils are further processed into HR plates as well as

Hot Rolled Pickled and Oiled Coils

/Plates (

HRPO

) based on the requirements.

Cold rolled steel products

The

HR coil

is eventually uncoiled and cleaned or pickled, in an acid-containing long tank. This process successfully removes the blue/black oxide and scales from the surface. After this, the steel is rinsed and trimmed before making its way to the cold reduction mill. The clean pickled coil’s leading end is then fed through a set of rolls and then, onto a recoiler. Cold reduction mills comprise up to 6 stands, and a majority are of the four-high variety. Through a combination of extremely high roll force and strip tension, the thickness of the steel is reduced at each stand progressively. The pickling and cold reduction are continuous processes. Post pickling, the strips are joined from end to end before they are passed through the reduction stands. Post cold rolling, the steel may be annealed or tempered to improve its metallurgical properties.

Coated steel

Coating on steel enhances corrosion resistance as well as the aesthetic value of the final product. Coated steel is further classified based on the type of coating process that is involved. These are tin coated steel,

Galvanised

(GI),

Galvalume

(GL), Galvannealed (GA),

Pre-Painted Galvalume

(PPGL), and Pre-Painted Galvanised (PPGI).

Long steel products

Long steel products are manufactured from billets or blooms in the hot rolling process. These mills differ significantly from flat products mills in the fact that the rolls that are used for bars and wire-rod products are profiled. In most cases, several passes are needed to produce the final shape. Several types of alloy steel are produced in the bars and

wire-rod

form. The technologies used are High Yield Quenched and Self Tempered to produce

TMT rebars

and ultimately ensure superior quality as well as sustainable products.

We will now look at some of the innovative technologies to minimise the environmental impact when it comes to the production of steel.

HYBRIT process

The goal of using HYBRIT or Hydrogen Breakthrough Ironmaking Technology is to produce zero-carbon in the process of steel production. This new-generation procedure uses hydrogen, which can remove oxygen present in the iron ore. Yet, the outcome is water vapour and not carbon dioxide. This leads to the formation of green steel.

Jet process

One of the latest technologies when it comes to exceptional converters is the Jet Process. Because of this advancement, a wide scope of scrap rates can be successfully handled in a highly profitable way. The Jet Process is an innovative technique for the amplification of scrap rates and HBI (Hot Briquetted Direct Reduced Iron) rates when it comes to converter steelmaking.

Molten oxide electrolysis

Molten Oxide Electrolysis is an unorthodox electrometallurgical system that makes it possible for quick production of metal from oxide raw material to the liquid state. It ensures significant simplification of the entire process and minimisation of essential energy needs.

The last word

The journey of steel from the initial raw materials right up to the finished product is quite fascinating. That said, it can take a toll on the environment, making it necessary to work towards eco-friendly and sustainable ways in the process of steel production. JSW Steel is committed to manufacturing sustainable and environment-friendly steel, increasingly in the future. We use technology such as High Yield Quenched and Self Tempered in production to ensure superior quality and sustainable products. We are also among the first Indian steel manufacturers to have received GreenPro Ecolabel certification which makes us environment-friendly and sustainable manufacturers. The steel industry across the globe is learning to adapt and change towards a greener future, and JSW is one among them.

Read the JSW One MSME Blog to  understand why MSMEs should be aligned with this latest industrial revolution.,N/A,3 Mins,industry-4-0-are-indian-msmes-all-set-for-the-next-wave-of-industrialization,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Industrialisation in India has a long history, stretching back to antiquity when India’s contribution to world GDP stood at a whopping 32%. By 1947, this dropped to a mere 2%. In the decades since, the Indian economy has witnessed modest growth punctuated by two periods of rapid growth. The first of these was in the late 1970s and 1980s, brought about with the introduction of partial automation, programmable systems, and robotics into Indian industry, often referred to as the third industrial revolution – or industry 3.0. The second period of rapid growth began with the dot-com boom in the mid-90s, with the widespread adoption of the internet paving the way for tech disruption. In the last 20 years, a rapid increase in computing power and breakthroughs in areas such as AI and machine learning have made true, machine-lead automation and analytics a reality, ushering in the fourth industrial revolution – Industry 4.0

What is Industry 4.0?

The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) is a modern technological revolution that aims to link people, processes, and machines using the power of technology. It is an amalgamation of traditional manufacturing practices and sophisticated technology integrated to eventually enable robots to make decisions with little to no human involvement. Industry 4.0 is linked to advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G, the internet of things, robotics process automation, biotech, and quantum computing.

In the context of manufacturing, industry 4.0 aims to introduce practical applications of these technologies to automate processes across all business functions ranging from marketing, and production management, to human resources management and more.

The scope of Industry 4.0 in India will entail addressing several challenges faced by the Indian industry that limit its ability to compete globally, such as the perception of low quality, fierce cost competition, lack of innovation, and a lack of agility to respond to rapidly changing customer needs. But this transition comes with its own set of challenges such as -

Requirement of heavy capital investment,

Shortage of skilled workers in this field and high rate of job loss due to automation,

Deficient technology integration and lack of awareness among industry leaders

Why should MSMEs adopt Industry 4.0?

The simple answer to this question is that Industry 4.0 is not a model that MSMEs could ‘adopt’, nor is it something to look forward to in the future – this all-encompassing change has been well underway for over a decade, and is here to stay. And businesses that are slow to adapt run a significant risk of falling behind.

At a time when small enterprises are under immense pressure to cut costs and increase competitiveness, embracing the technological paradigm behind Industry 4.0 can be a game-changer. According to a report

by McKinsey

, industry 4.0 implementation could potentially help Indian companies

increase their operational earnings by 40%

, at

less than 10% of the anticipated capital expenditure

across functions - including manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, and procurement. In addition, the report also found that MSMEs that have implemented industry 4.0 can respond more effectively to crises (such as the COVID19 pandemic)

At a macro level, industries in India need to change their narrative from one based on old systems of business processes and management practices to one that uses modern technologies for efficiency and greater flexibility in production activities. In recent years, Indian MSMEs have faced stiff competition from MSMEs in other developing economies such as China, most notably in electrical and electronics goods, as well as metallurgical/chemical engineering products. China’s larger economic base offers a significant advantage in low-cost manufacturing operations, which translates into a ‘growth capital gap’; therefore, to remain competitive against foreign competitors, MSMEs must adopt digitalization, and embrace industry 4.0.

Industry 4.0 – What’s in it for the small and medium enterprises of India?

Over time, the majority of India's medium- and small-scale industries have had difficulties assuring quality, productivity, profitability, and customer satisfaction. As per a study by

Forbes & SAP

, most manufacturing leaders report that Industry 4.0 will help MSMEs realise the following benefits (% of survey respondents):

Improved product quality (48%) -

Artificial intelligence-based visual quality inspections used by manufacturing businesses, help to quickly discover faults early in the production process at a cheaper cost with fewer human errors. This makes it possible to anticipate and stop production failure.

Increased productivity (88%) -

As it typically involves the use of equipment sensor controls, and other digitally aware devices that are networked to share data to trigger automatic production adjustments and give executives insights for digital decision-making. It helps businesses in managing operations with greater agility. Up until Industry 3.0, automation of processes had only been partial, requiring manual oversight in some cases. That human need might never again exist once the implementation of Industry 4.0 is complete.

3. Higher customer satisfaction (43%) - A

s it offers an opportunity to expand your ability to serve clients, resulting in an enhanced customer experience. For instance, you can solve issues rapidly with the automatic track, and trace capabilities through automated processes, responding faster and more efficiently than ever before (Ex. Chatbots). This means that customers will get quicker responses when they need assistance with something like an order or product delivery.

Also, Industry 4.0 has the potential to boost customer satisfaction and loyalty by making it easier for customers to access a range of services, products, and information through a variety of channels such as social media, mobile applications, wearable devices, and more. This can be especially helpful when it comes to making purchases online or in-store because it allows them to have more control over what they are buying and how they receive their goods.

4. Increased profitability (74%)

, will help reduce unnecessary capital expenditure by shortening the manufacturing cycles. Businesses can benefit from a reduction in their operational costs by using virtual assistants, automated systems, or robots to perform tasks that would otherwise require human labor. With more quality data inputs, businesses will find it easier to automate and streamline their workflows, fewer parts or components being produced, better inventory management, and lesser chances for human error resulting in increased profit margins.

Government schemes to help MSMEs benefit from Industry 4.0

The Indian government is making significant investments to support the development of Industry 4.0, including $2 billion for

""Digital India""

to make the digital shift. IBEF reports that the Indian government has set an ambitious goal to increase manufacturing output's contribution to GDP from its present level of 1 per cent to 25 per cent by 2025. The government of India has also taken initiatives such as Green Corridors and ‘Make in India’ in addition to announcing plans to spend $400 million on e-commerce and $1 billion on big data.

To facilitate and create an eco-system for the propagation of industry 4.0 in every Indian manufacturing business by 2025, irrespective of its size and scale -

SAMARTH Udyog Bharat 4.0

initiative has been launched by the GOI. Also, NASSCOM's programs and the Digital India initiatives are making efforts to increase digitalization in manufacturing and help industries adapt to Industry 4.0.

Given this momentum and the government's ambitious aims, it is anticipated that by 2025 India will join the league of nations that have already adopted Industry 4.0 by 2025.

One facet of this new phase of industrialization is digitalization, which is characterised by an increase in the use of digital platforms. Taking your business online is a good place to start if you are an MSME getting ready for the next wave of industrialization.

Industry 4.0 continues to open new avenues for partnering with quality suppliers with the power of online marketplaces like

3IMhs932AeaoCgjmDXUWgQ,Role of e-commerce in MSME growth,E-commerce for MSME | JSW One MSME Blog,"With growing popularity of ecommerce, not only B2B, but B2B MSMEs are also exploring the ecommerce platforms for their businesses. JSW One MSME, a B2B MSME too is looking forward to ecommerce. Read our blog to know more!",Technology,3 Mins,role-of-e-commerce-in-msme-growth,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Approximately 36.1 million MSMEs in India contribute to nearly 6.11 % of the manufacturing GDP and 24.6 % of the service GDP while constituting around 45% of the overall exports from India. However, currently, only 10% of the MSMEs in India are present online and 85% stay unregistered.

With the growing popularity of e-commerce, MSMEs, not only B2C but also B2B are now exploring the option of selling online and thus increasing their customer base. There is an evident shift in online procurement transactions is visible as many e-commerce aggregators continue to digitise traditional offline businesses – truck booking, healthcare, real estate, and industrial products to name a few.

Lately, the procurement needs of MSMEs have also evolved and seek more transparency. To be able to serve as a one-stop solution for smaller organisations, online B2B marketplaces are offering GST-enabled, technology-led solutions for enterprises. These platforms not only offer direct supplier access but also access to value-added services that help businesses cut down paperwork and enable price transparency.

E-commerce: A catalyst in the growth of MSMEs

MSMEs face an array of difficulties that keep the industry from reaching its full potential. These difficulties include digital illiteracy, poor reach, limited capital, supply chain bottlenecks and difficulty procuring raw materials.

As per a report by

Deloitte

, MSMEs that adopt an advanced level of digital experience in their businesses, experience annual revenue growth that is 27% higher than those who continue to operate traditionally, due to factors such as easier access to the market, ease in procurement, reduction in marketing and distribution costs etc.

E-commerce plays a massive role in bridging the demand-supply gap and this equation was only intensified during the lockdown. A rapid increase in internet penetration, the evolution of payment solutions, growth in smartphone adaption, 100% FDI investments opening the market (in B2B e-commerce), and the levy of GST has been providing a major impetus for businesses to go online. The accelerated digitisation across the sectors is vital for MSMEs to expand their reach, and is also a great platform to leapfrog obstacles of supply chain bottlenecks, procurement challenges and distribution and leakages in procurement processes.

E-commerce has also been instrumental in empowering MSMEs by helping them navigate the online route of doing business, creating a demand for their products and services, and providing a wider reach and an expanded customer/client base. It eliminates middlemen by giving them direct access to customers which enable improved market penetration, reach as well as margins. As a result, MSMEs can increase the scope and scale of their businesses and get a level playing field with their larger counterparts. From a buyer’s perspective, e-commerce ensures convenience, 24*7 availability, access to quality products at transparent prices as well as ease of returns and exchanges and an informed choice from a wide catalogue.

The road ahead

For MSMEs’ to thrive and remain competitive in the market, it is critical that they reduce the cost of their material procurement by procuring reliable and transparently priced sources.

Procurement which involves both direct and indirect spends impacts the operational costs majorly. While direct spends include core expenses in a business (for instance, procuring fabric for a garment manufacturer), indirect spends are unplanned expenses that are needed to keep the momentum going. And while these indirect expenses only account for 20% of the total expenses, they take up almost 80% of the time and bandwidth of the procurement managers. This happens due to hidden costs like – time costs, purchase costs and process costs. -procurement which involves business-to-business, business-to-customer, business-to-government or government-to-business buying and selling of services and products is the most effective and accessible method to solve all these problems. It saves time and ensures productivity since all products are available under one single platform. This allows the procurement managers to attend to matters that are more important, hence improving overall productivity.

MSMEs serve as both the economic backbone and the breeding ground for upcoming conglomerates. In addition to saving money and time, e-commerce has helped MSMEs expand financially because of increased productivity. With less paperwork, duplication of effort, bureaucracy, elimination of middlemen, and reduced leakages in procurement, procurement of materials online has become simpler. With added efficiency, MSMEs can  unlock their potential by streamlining their businesses and building efficiency through digital platforms."
7Bhvvcsori16WjFkuSwwVt,Heavy vehicle chassis: Which type of steel should you use ?,Types of Steel Used in the Automotive Industry | JSW One MSME Blog,"Types of steel used in a vehicle depends what type of vehicle it is for. Agreed? Read on to know about the types of steel like mild steel, stainless steel and wire rods used in vehicles!",Business,3 Mins,heavy-vehicle-chassis-which-type-of-steel-should-you-use,Read Now,N/A,N/A,"According to an industry

report

by Tech Sci Research, India's commercial vehicle market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6% between FY2023 and FY2027. In FY2021, the country's commercial vehicles industry was valued at about $4 billion. This included a fleet of more than 1.6 million buses, of which 170,000 are public transport buses servicing 70 million people daily. Other types of heavy vehicles include goods vehicles, vehicle carriers, agricultural vehicles, trucks, cranes, and special vehicles.

The chief driver behind the growth of this segment is the use of heavy vehicles by end-use industries such as public transportation, construction, road transport, utilities, and others.

The manufacture of heavy motor vehicles (HMV) presents unique challenges. These include the need for raw and intermediate materials with a wide range of material properties, including higher yield strength, durability, fatigue-life, impact resistance, corrosion resistance, and high life-cycle cost, among others. In particular, heavy-duty HMV chassis need to be able to withstand sudden shock, twists, vibrations, and other stresses regularly, unlike chassis used in LMVs or two-wheelers.

It is thus important to carefully curate and select the right mix of steel types for the manufacture of HMV chassis. Let’s take a closer look.

Heavy vehicle chassis - Components and type of steel used

These are the different components that collectively form the chassis:

1. The frame of the chassis

2. Engine

3. Suspension system

4. Steering system

5. Braking system

6. Wheels and tires

7. Transmission system – clutch, gearbox, etc.

Chassis frame

The frame is the most important part of any vehicle, as it provides support and strength for the other components. The frame is made out of

high-strength steel(HSS)

.

This type of steel has good resistance to wear, fatigue, and corrosion, and is stronger than low-alloy high-strength steel, but is not as strong as advanced high-strength steel (AHSS).

Engine

The steel used to make the engine block is more important than that used to make the pistons, and cylinder head, since it holds all other parts together.

As the engine is the main source of power for an HMV's drivetrain system,

high-strength low alloy

or HSLA steels are the ideal choice. HSLA steels have a higher yield strength than standard steels, which means they can be used under rough conditions without fracturing or cracking. This makes them a good fit for automotive applications where there's a lot of shock loading on the engine block.

As an alternative, an engine block can also be made from

cast iron

, which is a hardy, heavy-duty alloy of iron and carbon. It has a higher melting point than plain iron, which makes it stronger.

Suspension

The steel that is predominantly used to make suspension systems (such as leaf springs) for heavy automobiles is carbon-chromium spring steel (AISI 5160). It is renowned for its toughness, high yield strength, pliability, resilience, and high fatigue life. These physical qualities make this steel grade suitable for suspension applications.

Apart from carbon-chromium spring steel, four alternative materials are also popularly used for HMV suspensions -

Carbon steel

(good strength and durability but lower corrosion resistance compared to other alloys)

Stainless steel

(better durability and corrosion resistance but expensive compared to carbon steel alloys)

High alloy steel

(high strength, good corrosion resistance, and good ductility, but relatively expensive)

Cast iron

(relatively inexpensive high-strength alloy but is very heavy in weight, and has poor resistance to wear when compared with stainless steel or carbon steel)

Steering system

The type of steel used in the steering system varies depending on what type of vehicle it is for. For example, a sports car might use a different type of steel than an SUV would.

Broadly, there are three types of steel commonly used in steering systems:

mild steel

,

stainless steel

, and aluminum alloyed steel.

Braking system

The most common type of steel used for brake discs is

stainless steel

(an alloy of chromium and steel).

The braking system in heavy motor vehicles uses four different types of steel -

Cast iron

is used in the brake drums, shoes, and linings

Bearing steel

is used in the bearing races and bearings

Stainless steel

is used in drums and shoes

High-strength steel

is specifically used in linings and brake shoes

Wheels and tyres

Wheels and tyres can be made from different types of steel depending on their purpose -

Stainless steel

– This type of steel is more expensive than carbon steel but has better corrosion resistance, compared to carbon steel. It also has better wear resistance than carbon steel but is lower than alloy steel (which is made from iron and other metals). Stainless steel is resistant to rusting, so it is often used on wheels and in tyres.

Alloy steels

– These types of steels are made by combining several different types of metal into one composite metal which leads to higher strength and greater resistance to wear.

Transmission

The transmission system of heavy vehicles is made up of various components including the flywheel, clutch, gearbox and gears, collars, and drive shafts. Various types of steel are utilised for the transmission system as each of these components serves a different purpose, with a wide range of operational constraints.

Read on to know about various stainless steel grades, hot rolled, cold rolled stainless steel and more!",Product,3 MIn,stainless-steel-a-true-story-of-strength-and-resilience,Read Now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Stainless steel remains a popular alloy of choice for MSMEs in industries like food & catering, offshore oil & gas, water desalination, construction, power generation, shipbuilding, chemicals, medical equipment, and storage tanks. It can support incredibly heavy loads without risking fracture and is capable of being easily moulded to suit a wide range of business applications. Moreover, with stainless steel, there is a complete range of sizes and designs to pick from, so it’s highly “versatile.”

Stainless steel products

that have reached the end of their useful lives can be melted down and their constituent elements reclaimed and reused in new steel products without any adverse impact on performance. In fact, the recovery rate in recycling for stainless steel is close to 100%. According to the Steel Recycling Institute, one ton of recycled steel saves 2,500 pounds of iron ore, 1,400 pounds of coal, and 120 pounds of limestone. Versatility, tensile strength, and recyclability are the key factors responsible for stainless steel’s undying popularity after more than a century of existence!

What makes stainless steel so great?

Stainless steel is essentially a low-carbon steel alloy comprising mostly iron, along with chromium (at least 10.5%)  and, in some cases, other elements like nickel, molybdenum, silicon, and manganese in varying degrees. It’s the addition of chromium and other elements that accounts for the alloy’s incredible resistance to staining and corrosion. Chromium hardens stainless steel and gives it the ability to withstand wear and tear, pressure, or damage even at high temperatures, depending on its grade. As soon as the alloy is exposed to oxygenated environments, the chromium reacts with ambient oxygen to form a thin invisible and tight film of chromium oxide,  thus saving the underlying metal surface from corrosion.

All

grades of stainless steel

can support heavy loads without risking fracture. Certain grades can resist sub-arctic temperatures (-40°C) and extreme heat (870°C or higher)! Stainless steel is the preferred alloy for MSME manufacturers of medical equipment and devices because it is easy to sanitise and rid its surface of contaminants. Stainless steel medical tools with anti-bacterial coating can prevent infections or keep them in check.

Stainless steel is an umbrella term that applies to as many as 100 different grades of steel. Broadly, stainless steel falls into five groups (families).

Austenitic stainless steel

This is the largest, most common type of stainless steel, named after Sir William Chandler Roberts-Austen.  Austenitic stainless steel contains 16-26% chromium and up to 35% nickel and exhibits high resistance to heat and corrosion. Austenitic stainless steel can be easily welded or reformed without cracking or folding. However, it cannot be hardened by heat treatment.

“300 series” austenitic stainless steel is not just corrosion resistant but also maintains its strength at high temperatures. Grade 304 is the most widely used of all stainless steels and is most commonly utilised in high-temperature scenarios like cookware and heat transfer plates. Applications include medical equipment, automotive parts, springs, cutters, razor blades, jet engine components, and landing gears.

Ferritic

Ferritic contains 10.5-30% chromium and low carbon content (less than 0.20%). It works out cheaper than austenitic and duplex steels and possesses good ductility and corrosion resistance. It can be transformed into complex shapes without the application of heat (cold working, deep drawing). Applications includes automotive parts, industrial machinery, and kitchen ware.

Martensitic

Chromium makes up 11.5-18% of this stainless steel and carbon, 0.61-1.50%. In this respect, martensitic is similar to ferritic. However, martensitic has a higher carbon content than ferritic, and this gives it a special structural robustness. It is low on nickel; therefore, from a corrosion resistance standpoint, martensitic steels are weaker than other types of stainless steel.

“400 series” stainless steels are made of martensitic (or ferritic stainless steel) and these tend to be stronger and more wallet-friendly than the

300 series

though less resistant to corrosion. Grade 410 is the most popular of these and demonstrates good strength, hardness, and stress resistance. It is mostly seen in contexts that require high mechanical properties and moderate corrosion resistance such as in pumps, gas turbine blades. Its applications include medical devices, bearings, cutlery, turbine blades.

Duplex

At a granular level, duplex is roughly a 50:50 mix of austenite and ferrite and displays the properties of both. Typically, it is twice as strong as regular austenitic steels and, in a lot of cases, tougher than ferritic. It has high corrosion resistance. However, it is often difficult to cut duplex sheets into desired shapes and sizes owing to their toughness. Besides, they are not quite as easy to weld as austenitic steels. Applications would include cargo tanks, stainless steel pipes and tubes, heat exchangers, digesters, biofuel plants.

Precipitation hardened

Austenitic and martensitic steels are “precipitation hardened” by applying a series of heat treatments to make them stronger, tougher, and highly corrosion resistant. Austenitic steel is heated to less than 2050°F, then cooled slowly. It is next reheated, and during this treatment precipitates like copper, aluminium, and titanium are added to enhance corrosion resistance. Martensitic stainless steels are also precipitation hardened via a similar process. The difference is that these are heated to less than 1950°F.  Its applications include Nuclear waste casks, aerospace engine components, turbine blades, gears.

Read on to know more!",Product,3 minutes,difference-between-galvanized-and-galvalume,Read now,['Yes'],['Yes'],"Galvanised and galvalume steel are types of steel that are essentially used in building strong and durable structures and most often used in making roofs. To have an in-depth understanding of these metals and their usage, it is important to first understand what these teams mean, what makes these two types of steel different from each other and how to choose the right material. Here’s a detailed explanation for the same.

Both these metals are not all that different from each other by definition. That said, the advantages and drawbacks of galvalume and galvanized steel differ significantly, including their longevity, durability, and performance.

Galvanized Steel

This type of steel consists of a piece of steel that is cleaned and dipped into molten zinc. Following this, the zinc hardens onto the steel, thus creating a coating of extra protection. This enables the steel to combat dents, nicks, corrosion and rust.

Galvanized steel is the go-to option when it comes to construction, fabrication and manufacturing because of its durability and high resistance to corrosion. Galvanization can be found on a majority of steel structures. In general, galvanized steel will last nearly 15-20 years, requiring minimal maintenance.

One of the significant drawbacks of galvanized steel is that if the coating of zinc is scratched off the surface, the steel is left totally unprotected and subject to failure.

Galvalume

First, a tad bit of background. Galvalume was successfully invented in 1972 by Bethlehem Steel. It is basically a trademarked name, but many individuals use the term generically to describe a product of metal roofing that consists of a steel coil coated with an alloy of metal.

Galvalume consists of a sheet of steel that is dipped in a coating of aluminium (55%), zinc (43.4%), and silicon (1.6%). This unique coating imparts a greater protection to steel from the elements, which gives it the ability to outlast and outperform traditional galvanized steel.

Overall, galvalume is ideal as a roof, trim, wall, accent and much more in a majority of building applications. Moreover, it has proven its calibre in the most extreme and harsh environments, including high-temperature areas, hurricane zones, and regions that receive heavy rainfall or snowfall.

Galvanized vs Galvalume

As can be seen, the primary difference between galvanized and galvalume

is the type of protective coating around each sheet of steel. Galvanized steel has a coating of zinc, whereas galvalume’s coating is a combination of zinc, aluminium and silicon.

Both metal types are ideal for roofing, and each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Galvalume is much more durable and has a greater longevity, with a lifespan that is twice that of galvanized steel. Galvanized steel, on the other hand, is more cost-effective, while still offering great performance. This makes it an ideal choice for those on a stringent budget.

1avdBH3svxfnvwZpywgXPn,   Why is quality control essential in steel fabrication? ,Steel Quality Control |  Best Steel Online | JSW One MSME Blog,"Steel quality control is vital in production process of steel for quality and consistency, risk mitigation, cost reduction and compliance. Read our JSW One MSME Blog on to know more about steel quality control!",Business,3 Mins,why-is-quality-control-essential-in-steel-fabrication,Read Now,N/A,['Yes'],"Quality control is defined as a series of standards designed to measure quality. These standards serve as the guidelines for safety, cost reduction, compliance and strength, which are especially important in the steel fabrication process.

Thorough quality control, during the fabrication process, plays an important role in production. Besides improving your final product, quality complaint products also add to your reputation. On the other hand, if the finished products do not meet the necessary quality standards, there are risks of penalties, charges and related liabilities for both the manufacturer and the buyer.

Apart from the above, steel quality control is also vital for the following reasons.

1.

Quality and Consistency –

For a product to last longer, quality is imperative. When considering the quality of steel fabrication, it is important to assess things like alloy composition, the formation process, etc. Therefore, quality control begins right from the selection of material to the actual production of goods. Quality products not only result in the desired output but also ensures consistency in the manufacturing process.

2.

Risk mitigation –

A meticulous quality control process reduces the hazards associated with steel fabrication. Regular re-evaluation of fabrication designs allows the manufacturer to segregate faulty products.

3.

Cost Reduction –

There is a staggering cost associated with running a steel fabrication plant. It is vital to reduce such costs without compromising the quality and health of the workers. Quality control reduces the number of errors which in turn lessens input materials and waste.

4.

Compliance –

All fabricated materials must meet industrial quality standards. It can be vetted through certifications, licenses, accreditations and other permits and documentation. Proper compliance enhances the manufacturer’s credibility and reputation

When looking to create or even source the

best steel

, it is crucial to get it from a manufacturer that strictly exercises an in-house steel quality control process. To ensure quality control, there are several steps a fabricator and manufacturer can exercise before and after production. Here is a manufacturer’s checklist that you should take care of to evaluate the steel’s quality before you transfer it to the fabricator: -

1.

Metallurgical Test -

Test the steel by subjecting the material to thermal, mechanical and/or chemical actions to evaluate its properties. This will help you understand steel´s composition and structure to eventually predict its behavior under various circumstances.

2.

Hardness Test –

This is essential to evaluate the properties like strength, ductility and wear resistance

3.

Tension Test –

A tension test is performed to examine steel’s ability to withstand external forces without breaking

4.

Fatigue Test –

The fatigue test is exercised to determine the behavior of steel when subjected to fluctuating loads.

5.

Corrosion Test –

The corrosion test is done by destructing the metal (steel) with chemical, electromechanical or metallurgical interaction between the environment and steel.

Once the manufacturer has quality-tested steel from his end, there are certain quality checks that a fabricator has to conduct during the fabrication process to ensure that the final product is up to the mark.

1.

Maintain timelines for custom fabrication orders –

Missing timelines for custom orders can be detrimental to your reputation and customer relationships. Custom orders require double quality checks, hence maintaining timelines is vital, so that all the processes are complete in time.

2.

Maintain equipment maintenance schedule –

This will help you minimise costly delays and downtimes

3.

Ensure that the equipment meets the required specifications –

Defective and improperly calibrated equipment impacts the quality structure negatively, hence it is important to make sure that the equipment meets the desired specifications and is in order

4.

Measure the steel parts –

Measurement differences impact the durability and lifespan of the structure. The measurements mentioned in the design plan should meet the size of the steel fabrication. The measurement is done by a coordination measurement machine (CMM), a device that outlines the dimension points of a component and compares them to the measurements mentioned in the initial design plan.

In spite of steel being a powerful and durable metal, high standard processes during its fabrication are crucial to ensure its durability. Even the tiniest of details need to be accounted for and everything needs to be double-checked to ascertain the quality results.

Quality control protocols and dimension measurements are established to make sure that the steel quality is high and that each process is exercised meticulously. Although steel is not a metal that will give in to unfavourable conditions easily, many natural benefits of steel can be rendered useless if the fabrication process is faulty.

The main purpose of incorporating quality control measures in steel fabrication is to produce a quality product and create a win-win situation for both the manufacturer and the buyer. Hence, it is important to ensure quality during steel fabrication."
1U9ThiXTq0oNvZ6SlPzCtr,Hot rolled steel: Versatile like no other,Advantages of Hot Rolled Steel | HR Steel Coils | JSW One MSME Blog,"Hot rolled steel vs cold rolled steel, which is better? Both have certain advantages over the other. Click here to know more about the differences between hot rolled(HR) steel and cold rolled(CR) steel.",Product,3 Min,hot-rolled-steel-versatile-like-no-other,Read Now,['Yes'],N/A,"On a very basic level, steel is manufactured in one of two ways - cold rolling or hot rolling. In the hot rolling process, red-hot steel slabs are passed between a series of rollers at high speeds and at very high temperatures, usually over 1700°F, to form thin strips of uniform thickness and strength. The steel is tempered at extreme temperatures. The result is that it can be hammered thin or stretched into wires without the risk of fracture.

Once the alloy has been deformed into the desired shape and dimension, it is cooled in a controlled manner using water sprays.  The resulting hot rolled (HR) steel is “normalised” at room temperature, thus removing hardness, improving on its ductility, and overall strength. For context,

cold-rolled steel

is basically

hot-rolled steel

that has undergone additional processing at room temperature. Cooling from extreme temperature leaves HR steel with a characteristically thin, flaky surface texture and rougher feel. Typically, HR steel bars and plates feature slightly rounded edges and corners as well as modest distortions.

There are some clear advantages over others, including its cold-rolled counterpart. Cold-rolled steel has certain distinct applications and it is favoured over hot-rolled steel in those scenarios. The kind of steel MSMEs use is ultimately decided by the nature and scope of their projects.

Lower Steel Price Points

Hot rolled steel generally works out much cheaper than cold-rolled of the same grade because it requires much less processing. In cold-rolling, steel is flattened into smooth metal strips at room temperature. This is an additional process that demands quite a bit more force and energy, thus adding to the overall steel price.

High Malleability

When steel is hot-rolled at temperatures above its recrystallisation temperature (i.e., 750-1,300°F ) the material is altered irreversibly at its micro-level. HR steel owes its enhanced toughness and ductility to this process The steel that emerges from this process is highly ductile. As a result, unlike cold-rolled steel, it easily bends under great stress without fracturing or can be fashioned into various shapes and forms.

Reduced Production/Lead Time

There are far fewer processes around

HR steel

, it is ready for use once it is cooled to room temperature. There aren’t any major delays to speak of. In terms of ductility and ease of manipulation, hot-rolled steel is miles ahead of its cold-rolled kin. By extension, projects that make use of it will likely see faster completion.

Wide Use

It’s cheaper, easier to make, and comes in multiple grades (e.g., 304, 310S, 316L, 304L). These are arguments in favour of HR steel and what make this a popular choice for MSMEs as well as large enterprises across industries. Here’s looking at some of its major applications:

D-bars, standard joint bars, expansion joints, i-beams

Small-scale steel frames for bridge surfaces, ship decks

Automobile door hinges and truck rims

Forklift trucks, rail joint bars, tram rails

Agriculture and farm equipment components

Treads for excavators and tracked vehicles

Industrial fasteners, sheet pile connector

Pipe couplers, spigot joint, pipe fittings

Hot-rolled steel lacks the surface finish of cold-rolled steel as also the dimensional uniformity (tighter tolerance) and straightness. In scenarios where high precision is a requirement, HR steel is not a possibility. Hence it is not suited for aerospace structures with high strength-to-weight ratio, home appliances, and metal furniture with surface finishes, as well as strips, bars, and rods with precise dimensional tolerances.

Read on to know more about colour coated steel here.",Product,3 Mins,colour-coated-steel-the-perfect-blend-of-aesthetics-and-sustainability,Read now,['Yes'],N/A,"Pre-painting or colour-coating is simply described as applying a decorative or protective coating to a steel substrate in a continuous process after pre-treatment. These paint coatings are used to enhance productivity and add environmental benefits & strength to the substrate steel, while extending long-term protection from corrosion. The base material of

colour-coated steel

consists of an aluminum & zinc coating which protects the steel from corrosion by sacrificing itself and reacting with environment to form protective compounds. The pre-treatment layer not only improves the corrosion resistance, but also gives a good adhesion to the coating layer. This layer also gives the final colour to the product. It also imparts in steel an aesthetic finish and improves durability.

Colour-coated steel coils

are in increasing demand from a variety of business sectors ranging from construction to home electronics, fabrication, and even chipmakers, as consumers have become more self-assertive and want to have their goods in style.

Coated steel is generally categorized into three broad categories: -

Metallic coating: -

This is typically a coating of zinc in pure or alloyed form. This process is called galvanising. These coatings can be applied by using a sprayer, electromechanically, chemically, or mechanically. This kind of coating is applied on equipment requiring a shiny or glossy appearance. The metallic coating applications include air conditioners, vehicle parts, outdoor electrical boxes, laundry appliances, refrigerators, roofing sheets, etc.

Organic coating: -

Organic coating is a non-metallic coating, mostly polyester paint or polyvinylidene fluoride paint (PVDF). PVDF sheets are costlier as compared to polyester paint but give higher impact and scratch resistance. Organic coated sheets are generally used in lifts, furniture, ceilings, decorative partitions, etc.

Tinplates: -

Tinplates are made by coating tin on cold rolled steel. Annealing and tempering process is used to prepare a cold rolled sheet for tinning. Tin is applied to the black plate (tempered steel used as a substrate for tinplate) through the continuous electrolytic bath. The tinplate market is generally small as compared to other coated steel products and food industry investments are mainly driving this market.

Coating process

1. The coil is moved to the uncoiler whereby the steel is placed on a pay-off arbor for unwinding

2. The end of the previous coil is mechanically joined to the beginning of the next coil, which allows for the continuous feed of the coil coating line.

3. The entry tower will now allow the material to accumulate and continue the operation of the coil coating process. This accumulation will continue to feed the coil coating processes while the entry has stopped for the stitching process

4. The cleaning and pre-treating process focus on preparing the steel for painting. Dirt, oil, and debris are removed from the steel strip at this stage.

5. The steel enters the pre-treatment stage now and it goes through a chemical application to facilitate paint adhesion

6. The steel has to go through a dried in place chemical coater, where a chemical material is applied to provide enhanced corrosion performance

7. The steel strip now enters the prime coat stage wherein a primer is applied to the pretreated steel, after which the metal strip goes through a thermal oven to cure.

8. After the primer application, a final coat is applied to the steel strip. This topcoat provides corrosion resistance, colour, flexibility, and durability.

9. The coil is now removed from the line and packaged for shipment or additional processing

Tests conducted on the colour-coated steel

Ensuring the integrity of the coating is absolutely essential. There are severe risks associated with coating failure and hence testing the mechanical properties of a coating is one of the best ways to make sure that the coating can withstand the environmental and operational conditions in which it will be placed.

Impact test –

The impact test is exercised to judge the resistance of the colour coating to the mechanical damage.  It is carried out by the falling weight test as per the ASTM D 2774-84 standards. This method is used to check for cracks or loss of adhesion in areas other than the impact area.

Bending adhesion test –

This test is done to assess the adhesion of coating films to the steel substrates. A 180 degrees’ bend is made by applying force in a bending machine and the sample is folded twice the thickness of the substrate to assess the colour coating adherence.

Flexibility test –

This test is carried out to determine the flexibility resistance to cracking of colour coating on the substrate. It is conducted with the help of a conical mandrel. A sample of the coated steel sheet is bent over the mandrel through 180 degrees in one second, post which the colour-coated film is looked into for cracks and sheds.

Hardness test –

Also known as the pencil test, this test is done to examine the hardness of the coat to in turn assess the mechanical damage. The sample is fixed at the bottom of the equipment with the help of two fixtures. A minimum of 2H high hardness is essential for the substrate to clear this test as per the ASTM D 3363-74 standards.

Chemical Resistance Test –

The samples of the colour-coated sheets are immersed in distilled water, 5 % aqueous solution of NaOH, and 5 % aqueous solution of H2SO4 solution for 24 hours. The samples are then evaluated for any evidence of chemical attacks, blistering, disbondment, chalking, or cracking.

The corrosion control provided by the colour coating is remarkable as compared to either system used alone. The coating protects the base steel and extends barrier protection besides slowing down the zinc consumption rate. All these combined really provide longevity to the coated steel. Even after the coating is weathered down, the zinc is there to provide rust protection after the paint peels off.  This synergy provides at least 1.5 -2.5 times more corrosion protection than the sum of the lifetimes of zinc and colour coating used individually.  Besides corrosion resistance, the other advantages of using the colour coated steel are: -

Prevention from flaking and peeling

Excellent formability and design flexibility

Easy to install

Maintenance free

Recyclable and environment friendly

Lightweight but structurally strong

Thermal efficiency

Read on to know more about types of welding consumables and their impact on construction industry.",Product,3 Mins,consumables-corner-role-of-welding-consumables-in-the-construction-industry,Read Now,['Yes'],N/A,"Welding is a fabrication process. It involves joining metals and thermoplastics by means of coalescence. Flux and filler metals together are known as

welding consumables

. The flux serves as a deoxidizer to prevent metal oxidation whereas the filler metals aid in fixing the joints in the objects. The raw materials used in the production of these consumables include steel, low alloy steel, copper, aluminum, nickel, and rutile.

Welding plays a crucial role in building infrastructure across societies. Rapid urbanisation has led to an increased demand for improved infrastructure across the country, which in turn is driving the demand for welding consumables in India.

The welding consumables market in India was valued at the US $ 1022.10 Million in 2021. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.4 % in the next 5 years.

Types of welding consumables: -

The type of welding consumables used during welding depends on the nature of the job.

welding electrodes

,

welding wires

and

welding fluxes

.

Stick electrodes –

These electrodes are most commonly used for field welding repair. They have three different types of coating for different purposes.

The cellulose-based coating which uses a protective gas layer to protect the weld region. Cellulose ensures that a significant amount of material is molten during welding and higher penetration is achieved

The second type of coating contains minerals that produce slag.

The third kind of coating contains a combination of minerals and cellulose.

Solid wires –

These electrodes are used in metal inert gas welding. They require a shielding gas that protects the molten weld pool from atmospheric contaminants. Solid wires are the best consumables when working on thin materials like sheet metal.

Flux cored wires –

There are two types of flux cored wires – gas shielded and self-shielded.  Gas shielded wires require external shielding gas and the slag is easy to remove. On the other hand, self-shielded flux cored wires do not require external shielding gas because the weld pool is protected by gas generated when flux from the wire is burned. As a result, self-shielded flux cored wire is more portable because it does not require an external gas tank.

SAW wires –

Saw wires are used in combination with flux which results in excellent productivity. Following extended post weld heat treatment, SAW wires are designed to keep up the good mechanical properties

The construction industry is responsible for the creation of all kinds of structures varying in size, complexity, and uses. Ranging from small, simple structures like individual homes to large complex constructions like dams, bridges, and plants, structural durability is imperative. This is why the construction industry employs a large number of metals, especially steel, which is where welding plays a crucial role.

Welding technologies are extensively used in the construction industry, mostly for the fabrication of metal frameworks by fusing various metal components and to create and maintain non-structural components. Welding for construction can either be prefabricated in a shop environment or done entirely on-site.

Application of Welding consumables in the Construction Industry

The construction sector is very broad and can be divided into three major categories which differ based on the kind of structures they create.

Building Construction

Building construction is creating infrastructure for people to reside or work (residential or commercial). This sector usually employs welding in the creation of structural frameworks from metal components. Welding is used for connecting steel beams, trusses, and columns to support the walls, roof, and floor. Structural welding is not as widely used in small buildings as it is in high-rise buildings that require a lot of metal joints. Welding in building construction is also used for the fabrication of components like firewalls, stairs, and handrails.

Industrial Construction

Industrial construction enfolds all structures that are utilized industrially. These structures generally don’t stand alone but are a large part of systems of numerous systems that work together for specific purposes. These systems include manufacturing plants, refineries, mills, power generation stations, etc. Industrial construction is the most diverse across all sectors as it cuts across numerous industries. TIG welders are used for the maintenance and fabrication of structural frameworks, industrial equipment, pipelines, and support structures for large components.

Infrastructure construction

Infrastructure construction covers structures like bridges, dams, stadiums, highways, wastewater management systems, and railways. Welding application in infrastructure construction is mainly structural. That is because most of the structures in this sector are massive in terms of size and scale that completely rely on a metal framework created through welding. Certain infrastructures like bridges can be made entirely out of metal, while others like dams and water systems require a lot of pipe welding.

How to choose welding consumables

While considering the choice of consumables to use for a specific welding task, the composition of the consumables must be similar to that of the parent materials used. This will help you achieve a homogenous weld.

However, in some cases, for instance, when welding brittle cast irons, a filler with properties different from parent materials can be used. The weld thus created is a heterogeneous weld and the joint created is called a weldment.

Hence, when welding materials have different tensile strengths, the consumable chosen should match the material with the lower tensile strength, while the preheat temperature used should match what is required for the material with the higher tensile strength.

However, despite exhibiting many outstanding properties, steel also carries a risk of corrosion and rusting. Because of this, steel products undergo a process called galvanisation. Galvanisation is a process of applying a zinc coat over steel or iron products to protect them against corrosion.

Manufacturers follow different methods of galvanisation to improve corrosion resistance and steel quality depending on the constituents and thickness of the steel product. In this blog, we will take you through various methods of galvanisation to enhance the steel: -

1.Hot dip galvanising

involves dipping the steel into a melted zinc pool. Three main steps are involved in galvanising – surface preparation, galvanising and post-treatment. The base steel is first cleaned mechanically or chemically to ensure a quality bond is developed between the base steel and the zinc coating. Once it is cleaned, the base steel is fluxed to eliminate any residuals. It is then dipped into a liquid heated zinc to form a metallurgical bond. The last step is to let the coated steel react with the atmosphere so that the pure zinc mixes with oxygen to create zinc oxide. This causes a reaction between zinc and oxide particles in the air, which makes the final protective layer of zinc oxide. This type of coating is performed explicitly on complex shapes.

2. Electro galvanising

uses an electrical current in an electrolyte solution to transfer zinc ions onto the steel. This process electrically reduces positively charged zinc ions to zinc metal which are then deposited on positively charged steel. To ensure that the coating is smooth, manufacturers use grain refiners. Electro-galvanising is applied continuously to a roll of steel sheet. A typical zinc electrolyte-anode arrangement uses insoluble anodes and electrolytes of zinc sulfates or a soluble anode of pure zinc. The electro galvanisation method is used in steel products requiring uniform coating and precise coating thickness.

3.Pre-galvanising –

This method is used in steel mills, typically on products of a specific shape. Steel sheets are rolled through a cleaning process in pre-galvanising, similar to the hot dip galvanising process. The sheet is then passed through a pool of liquid zinc to recoil. One significant benefit of this method is that steel sheets could be galvanised with a more uniform coating within a shorter span. This method allows the manufacturer to galvanise steel sheets rapidly compared to hot dip galvanising.

4.Mechanical plating -

This coating is done for small steel parts and products, usually around 8-9 inches and weighing less than half a kg.

The automatic plating process cold welds the steel particles to a workpiece for applying a coating. It is done by putting small parts in a barrel with zinc. The steel parts are cleaned and flash copper coated before going into the plating barrel. The barrel contains zinc powder, glass beads and other proprietary chemicals. The next step in this process is tumbling the barrel, wherein the glass beads peen the zinc powder onto the product. At last, the coated products are treated with a passivation film, dried and packed.

5.Inline galvanising –

In this galvanisation method, steel tubes are tumbled in a pool of molten zinc, after which a conversion coating is applied to the steel tubes to avert the formation of zinc oxide and hydroxide. The conversion coating is also topped with a clear and inorganic topcoat. It is noteworthy that only the outside of the tubes undergo this process; the inside surface only gets a coating of zinc-rich paint. This method is used when coating thickness and ductility control is needed.

6.Sheet galvanising –

Sheet galvanising is another hot-dip process applied to products like steel sheets, strips and wires. This process begins with cleaning the base product in an alkaline liquid, brushing, rinsing and drying. The steel then passes into the heating or annealing furnace to impart the desired strength and formability. In this furnace, the steel is put under a reducing gas atmosphere to eliminate any oxide from the surface. The steel enters a vacuum chamber to prevent air from reoxidising the heated steel product. The steel then gets into the molten zinc bath before being sent around a submerged roll to create the bonded coating. The product finally gets withdrawn from the tub, and an air knife is used to eliminate any excess zinc.

JpFx9h525Je0aa2W8dsXJ,TMT Bars – Building blocks of modern construction,All About TMT Steel Bars | TMT Rebars | JSW One MSME Blog,Selecting and buying the best TMT bars is indispensable to construct long lasting buildings. Agreed? Read on to know more about TMT Steel Bars and Rebars.,Product,3 Mins,tmt-bars-the-building-blocks-of-modern-construction,Read now,N/A,['Yes'],"Building a long-lasting structure not only needs a massive amount of time, money, and care but also quality materials that can preserve their value for the long term. So many buildings deteriorate and cave in too early, often because of the low-grade raw materials used at the time of construction. Not only concrete, wiring, pipes, flooring, etc. but also the steel bars that form the mainframe on which a building stands.

Steel and concrete need to work in tandem to provide support to a building. Although concrete is extremely strong in compression, it derives its strength from its reinforcement with steel bars. Nowadays,

TMT bars

are considered the best steel bars. They help the building structures combat induced forces like tensile and shear while concrete resists the compressive forces. Civil engineers today use TMT bars for almost every structural construction including dams, bridges, industrial structures, airports, power plants, residential buildings, etc.

TMT Bars are known for fire and corrosion resistance. TMT Bars are layered with coats of chromium, copper, and phosphorous which help the TMT bars withstand corrosion. These bars also have high thermal stability which makes them capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 600 degrees Celsius.

Apart from them being fire and corrosion resistant, the following characteristics of the TMT make it a preferred choice of reinforcement bars for construction managers: -

It mixes extremely well with concrete which makes it more resilient to any kind of load

It is highly resistant to earthquakes due to a combination of higher strength and ductility

It can be easily welded due to its low carbon content. It can be easily butt-welded, lap welded and manual arc welded without any pre-heating

Its inherent microstructure also makes it easily bendable

The outer layer of TMT bars is ingested with solid strength which lets it help a structure hold off any kind of dynamic loading

If you are planning to buy TMT bars, you must ensure that your purchase is quality assured at the best prices. It needs to establish an equilibrium between toughness and flexibility with high ductility, strength, and weldability.
